0,doc_1,a pretty good movie not quite the masterpiece that some would have you believe its too derivative for that but its still worth a watch and theres no denying that joaquin phoenix delivers an excellent performance in the title role my main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesnt need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre setting up the rivalry with batman for at least half the running time its a better film than that and would have served better as a standalone psychological portrait of mental breakdown films this seems to have been inspired by include the mechanic the king of comedy and of course taxi driver,positive
1,doc_2,gotham is in dire difficulties like new york city back in the 70s arthur fleck joaquin phoenix is a mentally unstable clown he laughs uncontrollably in stressful times he gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths he gets fired from his job he lives with his unstable sick mom frances conroy who worked for thomas wayne and claims him to be her exlover and arthurs biological father when arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway he shoots them dead thomas wayne is outraged by the killing of these three welleducated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayors office arthur has a relationship with his singlemom neighbor sophie dumond zazie beetz and admires talk show host murray franklin robert de nirothis is great character work from joaquin phoenix he is one of the great actors working today director todd phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise i do have a couple of problems with his work the smaller problem is the continuous shooting of thomas wayne and martha wayne with her pearls that scene has been done so many times in the past three decades it may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun dont show the shooting just do the sound of the shot and leave its all been done before and phillips should know this the bigger issue is setting up this world i think phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given the streets have lots of garbage there are news reports phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie it needs a wall street protest or two at least there should be a protest in front of wayne tower the first clown protest against wayne seems to come out of nowhere the hatred of the rich needs some background overall this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on,positive
2,doc_3,while ive watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike they are often the same so the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and nonstop action they are fun and i dont mean to dis them what is missing is a truly psychological drama we dont get into the heads of the characters this film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons we see him made fun of attacked and beaten when he responds he is seen as crazy he also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor and his mother has kept a secret i thought it gave us a foundation for the batman mythos without getting to deeply into it acting atmosphere and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film,positive
3,doc_4,in many aspects it is a mirror for society for viewer for the way of development of society its basic virtues the splendid performance of joaquin phoenix and the beautiful cinematography and sure the ignore of comic book character for feel the film not as portrait but as large cry the sins maybe too much taxi driver and the ambition to explain and show everything the angry the frustrations the refuges the falls of mind and soul are only suggested for be in real sense credible short a form of manifesto or only a sort of mirror for each of its viewers,neutral
4,doc_5,in a crumbling gotham city where the government has simply given up failed clown joaquin phoenix goes from loser to an acclaimed clown vigilantethis movie is about the creation and rise of batman villain the joker it draws on the societal collapse of the 1970s and 1980s with references to bernie goetz robert de niro present to make the audience think of taxi driver and his failed and insane comic in the king of comedy it could have been a reference to lend a veneer of cinematic respectability to this movie comic books arose lazily repurposing shards of popular culture for an audience too young to recognize them for what they were during the depths of the depression it was a time that led people to believe that society was in inevitable collapse large swaths of the audience believed the same it could have been obvious and cheap except for all the trash in the street and phoenixs committed performance as it is with the 1980s standing in for society today society in the 1930s batman is not even present just his father who might be phoenixs father also emphasizing the duality that keeps being imposed on the relationship who it is implied could do something but doesnt well its a thoroughly unlikable and well made movie just because i dont like the message i dont insist on shooting the messenger even though ive heard this message many times so the implication is that its been ignored and will keep being repeated until attention is paidif only it didnt glory in the dirt and destruction,positive
5,doc_6,this is joker a movie and the title is really telling whatwho it is about but first things first the director is todd phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2hour movie phillips is still mostly known for his hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with zach galifianakis so gentlyspeaking the filmmakers career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics this one here is no exception either general moviegoers apparently really loved it but critics not so much a bit like bohemian rhapsody not too long ago that one i really adored though this one here not so much still i am a big joaquin phoenix fan and as such it is impossible to give the film a thumbsdown overall he is the movie and i am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise i maybe would not have liked it at all not just because of personal preference but also because phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene not too long ago jared leto played the joker batmans nemesis and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to margot robbies harley quinn but lets not drift away from this film here now for phoenix all the hype is justified and welldeserved i think he is still up there and a potential contender for the oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and i read that it could be between him and adam driver and i like both for being slightly oddball so i certainly approve of course with stuff like her the master and my personal favorite walk the line under his belt it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette but i still hope he does if we consider daniel daylewis retired now he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under that is quite impressive at least in my opinion but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well he does so much with his eyes okay you get the message i thought he was an amazing jokersadly i cannot say the same about the film itself really there are good moments here and there no denying at all but i was still not satisfied with the script i must say it felt to me that most of all they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser but somehow i must say that the film felt zero daring to me even the interactions with the wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all i did like however that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the joker who kills bruces father in the end because of the personal connection but it was just one of his army eventually and it does not matter who did it joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore he has others who do so for him also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on his mother de niros character most of all are killed by him i must say i did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother i mean as for the colleague at his apartment it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short but still the cops were following him and that was accurate there however clownmania was already going on in full force you could say big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away i would say i disagreein general this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonists head like his relationship with the neighbor but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake even if i did not see it coming of course also the relationship between his mother and mr wayne okay that seemed fairly farfetched from the beginning i mean joker cannot be batmans halfbrother can he or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about de niros character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show so this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence such as the killing of the three young men on the subway or the talk show host murder or the killing of his mother or maybe is that fake too i mean it is a big step even if she did invent the relationship with bruces dad he really really cares for her and he wont kill the colleague who always treated him well i thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knobkey but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually he is a psychopath yes but with his very own unpredictable style of course there are aside from that these moments with all the overthetop laughing most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else the average peopleokay i think this would be pretty much all then i mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me maybe most likely you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from there is hardly one that is really weak and i think the running time was accurate too and i dont say that too often about 2hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions so you can see it as a compliment but like i mentioned previously already those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing i think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing this also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow there is a fairly memorable quote from fleck joker in his human form about that that they really could have made a lot with also they included it in the trailer storywise but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me okay we get it gotham is not at a good place to be right now but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly okay that would be all then i liked and disliked about this film it certainly wont make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the oscars for best picture that is too much i think but i wish phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness there was always a lot of arguing about whos the best joker nicholson ledger hamill romero there is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now all in all the film gets a thumbsup from me,neutral

8,doc_9,low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this films success although not the biggest part the levels of expectation on a dc universe film is now pretty low to the point that someone with film ocd like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this the sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film but it is not the main thingthe main reason is the central performance of phoenix he is totally committed to selling his character throughout and even in the weakest moments of narrative you believe his character in terms of its roots development and actions it is not a film that would normally be associated with awards but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film a secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of scorsese in so much as it falls between taxi driver and king of comedy this is not accidental and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of phoenix and de niro although the latter does more as a reference than an actor with these elements working well the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character i could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did because im not sure that the maybe it was all imagined bit at the end was a good ideaotherwise it is enjoyably dark and deliberate and is driven by phoenix even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe,positive
9,doc_10,this film is strictly a character development of arthur fleck joaquin phoenix and how he transformed into the joker they could have done this in a number of different ways in this film he is a deranged vigilante in the battle of haves vs have nots we do see bruce wayne as a child with arthur many years his senior it takes about minutes until the big action happens i was a bit disappointed when they made joker braindamaged rather than a criminal mastermind the production takes place during the time span of about a month or so his childhood is discussed but not shownguide fword no sex or nudity no batman no harley quinn,positive
10,doc_11,mental health issues are a problem in our society or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled the depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie is quite something even scorsese would approve i reckon were talking about a performance too that really surprised me i never thought id see another joker characteractor coming close to what heath ledger did over a decade agobut here we are or are we a question for a different time i guess with a new joker but a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet joaquin is so mesmerizing that i would not be surprised if he got the oscar since the nominations came out we know this is a possibility but everyone who watched it was expecting him getting nominated that the movie would get nods though that was quite unexpectednot all is as it seems as with this movie being a drama rather than a thrill park ride now that doesnt mean you have to have one thing and not the other as a big fan of the mcu i can admit really liking this then again this is not even near the dcu dont compare this to something other be it comic books or like a friend to parasite another favorite of mine of enjoy it for what it is a great movie,positive

12,doc_13,right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie it may be based on a comic book character but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty abusive parents disrespect for authority the distance between the haves and the havenots and an uncaring society at large with a plot often times structured on ambiguity the film explores the troubled mind of one arthur fleck brilliantly portrayed by joaquin phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career no offense intended to jokers who have gone before but phoenixs take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow but virtually impossible to match i must say the hype engendered by the film prior to its release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated yes there is violence on arthur flecks part all of it gruesome but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the saw series for example or any number of slashergore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to entertain fans of that persuasion together director todd phillips and joaquin phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds its release in savage sociopathic behavior though he may be called the joker as arthur fleck himself would surely attest no ones laughing now,positive

starring brian tyree henry as carl the arkham clerk and hannah gross as young penny phoenix delivers a chilling and compelling as the man who slowly loses his sanity and turns to a life of crime and de niro does well with his time onscreen as the man the luckless loner admires and one of the men along wayne he obsesses over this works well as a character study showing how monsters are made an origins story about the dark knights archnemesis and a nod to the martin scorsese film the king of comedy and not just casting de niro and it makes room to take a swipe against at healthcare cuts and poverty it is very controversial and very dark with its crime elements moments of violence and brutality and featuring the song rock and roll part by gary glitter with what we know about the singer it may be wrong to find this song catchy but i dont care and it is at times depressing and uncomfortable but what else would you expect a gritty and great psychological thriller it won the oscar for best

like a good movie if youve never seen taxi driver or the king of comedy but heres my struggle those movies have something to say something to prove they aspire to be art when this film is simply commerceif you think this is a good film tell me what it has to say tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than the joker is cool or this is the jokers origin story what is the purpose of watching a mans horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the wayi mean is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing

to get people to cancel this movieive heard words like groundbreaking and oscar being thrown about because of this movie as a society weve really devalued those two words huhthis is a movie that may not even be about the real joker it might not even connect to anything and its a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody its also a waste of two hours of your timeman i should work in some other nice things the cinematography feels large in scope when so many other films seem small these days i also loved seeing the old warner brothers logoi mean this won the gold lion at the venice film festival it also had an eightminute long standing ovationi sat there waiting hoping struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying that was a movie it should be something moreinstead ill have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance these are the same people who think naming the comedy club pogos comedy club is daring because it references john wayne gacy instead of hammer soft ironywe deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something im not being an elitist i love popcorn films and if you read this site you know i have a soft spot for italian horror and 80s slashers but when i see something that is s i have to call it the purest s ive seen in years,negative

28,doc_29,avatar is polarizing with its effects but ordinary with its storytelling and plot it shows off explicitly impressive graphics and exquisite acting but still when discussing plot elements youd like to say the film does something bigger and badder to commemorate the hype sadly it gives us traditional storyline one of the few letdowns of the filmbut im making it sound like i didnt enjoy this one bit avatar is a beautifully made work of film art in the sense of almost every medium it utilizes including the obligatory 3d which is used surprisingly more as a visual enhancer than a gimmickits the year a handicapped man named jake sully is sent to an rda corporation in replace of his brother who had recently passed away unlike his brother jake has basically no idea of what to do or what to expect during the project the main objective is to create avatars the humans control to explore the world of pandora pandora is populated by a paleolithic form of blue skin creatures taller than humans and resembling a feline form the texture and detail in the creatures is spectacular and a true visual work of artthats all i want to give away and even with that it looks as if ive said too much avatar develops the love story like wed expect but even in its cliché state it feels cameron did all he could to prevent the predictable turnout still its not that the story is completely intolerablethe effects like youd expect consume the entire extravaganza to begin with cameron is known for his revolutionary filmmaking expensive budgets and big name actors avatar is no exception to any of those rules the film has a unique look to it in more ways than one but in the effect field it shines vibrantly its a technical breakthrough possible paving the way for a new generation of movies to follow and live up toi think what i enjoyed the most from avatar is its constant action the films plot isnt thick but it seems to have so much happening so much going on and so much unfolding its almost impossible to look away thats one of the highest compliments of any film the fact that it is never a bore to watch its consistently entertaining and achieves an extremely difficult greatnessavatar is more a breakthrough than anything it is an imaginative work of art in every field but the storytelling theres going to be three categories of fans for this film people that love the film and everything about it people like me who are pleased but not blown away by the turnout and the people that show their inner cynic and hate the film and everyone who loves it i will say the film doesnt force you to like it if it did we wouldnt have that third categorystarring sam worthington zoë saldaña stephen lang michelle rodriguez and giovanni ribisi directed by james cameron,positive
29,doc_30,you wanna know something funny not even a year ago early i was watching the directors on the reelz channel and james cameron was on i was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors he has an amazing track record of great movies but wait has he done anything since titanic i went on the net to check to see what he has done since titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called avatar i read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and i was just in awe i was extremely curious to see this movie and couldnt wait as when we hear the name james cameron you cant help but expect nothing but greatness the man is a perfectionist and it shows he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with avatar my only complaint being like titanic the story not being the most original on the market but i cant at all hate this movie originally wanting give this movie a rating i find myself thinking that i cant this is one of the most visually beautiful movies i have ever seen in my life my boyfriend and i saw this in 3d and i just couldnt take my eyes off the screen james cameron is back and i hope he never leaves hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with avatarin the rda corporation is mining pandora a lush earthlike moon of the planet polyphemus in the alpha centauri star system humans cannot survive exposure to pandoras atmosphere for very long and use gas masks in an attempt to improve relations with the natives scientists create humannavi hybrids called avatars controlled by geneticallymatched human operators jake sully a former marine becomes a lastminute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother a scientist trained to be an avatar operator dr grace augustine the head of the avatar program considers sully an inadequate replacement for his brother and relegates him to a bodyguard role jake escorts augustine and biologist norm spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the navi in order to help establish diplomatic relations solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence the group is attacked by a predator and jake becomes separated and lost forced to survive the night in pandoras dangerous jungles he is rescued by neytiri a female navi neytiri brings jake to hometree which is inhabited by neytiris clan the omaticaya moat the navi shaman and neytiris mother shows interest in the warrior dreamwalker and instructs her daughter to teach jake their waysi had another fellow imdb user email me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that cameron has been working on the story for yearsmany thanks to oldman007 for the info and just now had the opportunity to work on it i think that cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good times from the money he made on titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for avatar was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief from the actors the special effects the visuals and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the minute running timeim sure avatar is sure to be in for the run during oscar time wither it gets a best picture nod or not im not sure but from what ive seen this does deserve every award it can get i feel very bad if im over hyping the film too much for you i dont want people to get the wrong idea that this is the casablanca of the new millennium but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in hollywood to put out a great movie sigourney weaver and zoe saldana stole the show and i think the reason being is because cameron can make females very strong beautiful but doesnt over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver sam worthington as the leading man jake i was a bit worried as i saw terminator salvation which was like spitting in james camerons face he was the star in that film too and i thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film thankfully i was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen its a masterpiece1010,positive

31,doc_32,avatar without a doubt pushes the movie making limit and that can be expected since its a james cameron film whos a master of scifi and adventure fantasy films and with this latest he clearly pushes the envelope with the graphics of digital computer 3d and cgi which is becoming more and more common in film still if you dont get caught up in all of the special things you will find that this film avatar is a journey of wonder adventure and excitement that involves exploring new lands and new people of a different culture neat and crazy to look at the blue aliens and winged creatures yet this is a cameron film its all about going big to far out lands and pushing the imagination to the maxthe story centers around a paraplegic ex marine jake sullysam worthingtonwho enters an experimental government program that is being ran by a group of scientists dr grace augustinethe veteran sigourney weaveris the bitchy programmer of the experiments which involves putting humans like jake into compartments that travel them into the distant moon planet of pandora with the goal to extract and find the planets natural resources from the resident aliens that live on the planet who are called the navi and along the way just like any other planet conflicts drama bonding and war will be found yet most notable is the unlikely love found with jakes guide thats once hes blue occupied and that happens to be the lovely neytiri and this is a fun experimental ride all the way in which the blue alien culture of navis come to be savedwith the technology and effects combined with the journey this film takes of showing a future world it certainly lets a viewers imagination run wild true this genre of film may not be everyones cup of tea yet its one to be looked at and respected due to the masterful and precise work of one of the great directors such as james cameron,positive

34,doc_35,im not sure that filmmaking can get any better than this i have a gut reaction to want to dislike james camerons blockbusters i avoid them like the plague for the longest time before finally deciding to give in to the hype and check them out years ago i had that gut reaction to titanic and then was completely blown away when i watched it ive had the same experience with avatar a movie that i had no interest in watching but now that i have has left me breathless its camerons best work ever superior even to titanic which i loved once i watched itthe film is visually stunning in many ways the world of pandora a moon of a distant gas planet comes to life in every way from the navi tribe around whom the movie revolves to the various animals that inhabit the world to the trees and the sky it was all real the animation and computergenerated characters used to portray the navi were breathtakingly real theres only a hint every now and then usually in their movement and not in their appearance that these are in fact computergenerated characters and for the most part its easy to forget that these arent actors in makeup the visuals alone make this a mustsee and even if the story had been lacking would have made this a worthwhile movie but the story wasnt at all lackingcameron who also developed the story and wrote the script created an emotionally moving story that pulls no punches and hits a number of buttons so that the viewer gets the underlying message but never feels preached at its an epic adventure movie that reminds us of some of the tragedies of our own history and warns us of some of the dangers in our own future the first parallel that came across to me was the clash of cultures i immediately thought of the tragic encounters between native americans and europeans of centuries ago from which native americans still havent recovered the story revolves around a team of scientists and marines sent to pandora to study the planet but and more importantly to mine the planet for an ore thats worth an astronomical price back on earth greed overcomes curiosity quickly and the marines begin to play centre stage almost from the beginning as it becomes obvious that the company financing this mission is willing to go to any lengths to get this precious metal theyll make cursory attempts to talk the natives off the land but if that doesnt work and one gets the distinct impression that they dont really want it to work theyre quite prepared and even eager to force the natives off the land and kill them if necessary sound familiar the next parallel or rather mirror image i suppose was the reverse take on alien invasion movies here its clear that were the alien invaders simply looking to rape a world of everything in it thats valuable with no regard or concern for the worlds indigenous inhabitants its interesting to see humanity portrayed in a different lightthe aspect of the story that i appreciated the most i think was the extremely spiritual nature of the film the navi have a connection with creation that is deeply moving and that draws the sympathy of the viewer almost from the beginning sympathy turning to anger as humans begin to destroy the world that the navi are so interconnected with the spirituality of this clan and of how it affects their interactions with the world with each other and with these alien invaders is truly interesting to watch as its slowly unfolded for us this is not a hollywood movie that disses spirituality instead it seems to cut to the heart of spirituality and to what spirituality should be about the building of community and of relationships and the glue that holds those things together very much related to this is a softsell but noticeable if you pay attention environmental message as the navi see their world being plundered the point is made that these humans have already done away with all the green on their own planet and are now going to do the same to pandora and at the end as the marines pull out the point was made that they were returning to their dying world it never felt like a preachy environmental message to me but it was obvious and well made perhaps making the point more effectively than if it had been the centre point of the storythe performances here were great sam worthington as jake scully is a character to root for hes the paraplegic marine who inhabits a genetically engineered navi body his avatar and as he comes to know the tribe becomes increasingly sympathetic to them to the point of wanting to be one of them zoe saldana was great as neytiri the navi female with whom jake falls in love and sigourney weaver was convincing as dr grace augustine the head scientist who gradually comes to realize that science is the least concern of the company that has sent her and her team to pandora perhaps the best performance though was that of stephen lang as colonel quaritch the commander of the marine unit he was gung ho about taking over the world ice cold with no sympathy at all for or interest in the navi he was truly a frightening character for a movie that is in many ways very gentle and spiritual it also leads up to a stunningly portrayed final battle scene as the navi take on their human invaders and to a marvellous final confrontation between jake and quaritchthis is a brilliant movie truly in my opinion one of the best ever made,positive

36,doc_37,avatar is james camerons million parable on the evils of imperialism corporatism and manifest destinythe time is the place an earthlike moon called pandora where an american company has set up a major mining operation to extract a precious mineral presumably an energy source from beneath the planetoids lush verdant surface the problem is that one of the richest veins lies directly under a massive tree that holds great spiritual significance for the indigenous folk who live there a race of ninefoottall bluecomplexioned natives called the navi who dwell in the forest wield oldfashioned bowsandarrows fly around on giant pterodactyltype birds and have a strong pantheistic connection with the world around themas the story begins it is clear that thus far the earthlings have had very limited success in winning over the navi through such outreach efforts as building them schools and teaching them english fortunately a group of scientists have found a way to create facsimiles of the navi called avatars into which a human mind can be transported while the original body remains behind in a state of suspended animation enter jake sully a young marine whos lost the use of his legs in battle and now has been chosen to enter into an avatar so he can learn more about the navi by living amongst them in the hopes of eventually winning them over to the americans side unfortunately not everyone is as concerned with making nice with the navi as is grace augustine the humanistic biologist who heads up the research and jake soon discovers that the more he comes to feel like a navi himself the more he is expected to spy on and then betray his newfound compatriots in the earthlings cause jakes gradual transition from cocky humancentric warrior to natureloving ersatzalien provides the dramatic and thematic arc of the filmthe parallels between the conflict in avatar and americas involvement in the iraq war are never far from camerons mind and the movie suffers a bit for it ironically avatar is a far more overtly political film than the hurt locker which is actually set in iraq i suspect that had he wanted to cameron could probably have gotten his point across without taking a narrative sledgehammer to the audience heck theres even a reference to shock and awe as the americans gear up for battle just in case you missed the inference that being said avatar is enough of a technical triumph to overcome its occasional heavyhanded polemical tendencies and to successfully take us to a place weve never been beforethrough the wizardry of computergenerated 3d special effects cameron has created a magical world of shimmering forests floating mountains and strange and exotic flora and fauna a place where love can convincingly flourish between creatures from alien worlds and alien species in fact the romance between jake and a female navi who teaches him the ways of her people an even more unlikely coupling than rose and jack in titanic has something of a new world quality about it and indeed camerons nearworshipful attitude towards nature here echoes terrance malicks work in that earlier film actually that seems a particularly appropriate reference point given that avatar can easily be viewed as an allegory of the european white mans conquest of the american continent and the genocide perpetrated on the native population that played such a crucial role in bringing that outcome about the look of the movie is something akin to a john howe painting done in bold florescent colors and placed under a black lightof the performers its frankly a little hard to evaluate fully sam worthington and zoe saldanas work in this film since clearly much of what appears on screen is the product of cgi manipulation and enhancement but theyre both certainly adequate to the task theyve been called upon to fulfill and sigourney weaver as grace and giovanni ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine and the movies arch villain turn in genuinely powerful performances and once again as with titanic james horner provides a soaring powerballad to help transition the audience out of the theater and back into the real worldalmost inevitably perhaps avatar is one of those movies wherein the storyline is bound to become at least partially subsumed by the special effects but as he did with titanic though to a somewhat lesser extent in this case cameron proves that he is capable of finding that happy medium between the two sides better than most,positive
37,doc_38,i hesitated almost a full month before seeing avatar a movie that apparently the world saw first and when i saw world i mean everyone even people who have never see a movie or even have the technology or places to go to see movies saw it i delayed my viewing as it was not a movie i was interested in seeing in the first place and the trailer made me snicker at the tall skinny smurf peoplebut i broke down and saw it as i knew i was going to see it anyways and the small screen or even a would probably not do the large scaleaction flick justice even further i needed to see it in imax3d just to get the whole effect was i disappointed yes and nothe special effects were amazing as was the cinematography that was breathtaking but the fx and scenery was only good when the blue people or the navi werent on the screen yes i realize theyre on practically the whole time you enjoy the rest of the cgiworld of pandora and i think the technology has thoroughly advanced through the years but i just didnt buy it i just didnt think theyre there just yet i almost laughed each time i saw them but i never truly believed them to be anything but computer generated images everything else aside from one of the doglike creatures looked absolutely fabulousunfortunately looks can be deceiving for example as stunning as the of the graphics were in addition to the flights the story looked as old and stale as most of the moments in human history it mimicked i guess it was no secret the plot is without any teeth or any bit of originality so stating its a very abc movie is just irrelevant my guess is they or just king cameron knew this hes not stupid and just said lets just throw in as many trickscgigadgets as they could possibly think of as distractions to deter from the central plot it is very well known to people i associate with that story comes first always i could be thrown a million things even in 3d but that doesnt stop me from looking deeper for anything resembling not only originality but heartwas the movie bad no i wouldnt go that far but the race to cover up the lackofstory with a billion fx kinda got old and made me look at the time more than once not only was i kinda bored with the attempts to impress me but i was still waiting for the basic c elements of the abc plotformula which mercifully finally arrived the basic storyline a dances with wolves with the titanic theme dang i got really frustrated with hearing titanic all throughout this film because titanic was 12x better a movie involves a last minute death of a man who was supposed to inhabit a navi body in the longdistant future in order to infiltrate an alien species on another planet his mission was to bring back information or haha like i believed this negotiate a relocation of the navi so that earthmen can harvest a rare substance in order to reboot planet earth after humans did a fine job of destroying itwell thank goodness the dead spy had a twin brother but unfortunately hes also paralyzed from the waist down that doesnt really matter when your mind is transferred to a navi body im spending way too much time on this 15minuteplot so ill fast forward and its no shocker when its all spoiled in the previews anyways he joins scientists gets separated and meets up with a navi or make that naïve woman naytiri saldana who spiritually think hes the chosen oneshe trains him while he remains loyal to a very bad man or high ranking military cliché who works for someone so incredibly cartoonish parker ribisi that i had to laugh at every unbelievable moment he was on screen but lo he starts to see life in the blue becomes one of the blue and its red white and blue vs the other bluethe handicapped characterturnedspy jake worthington or again i should say worthless is so braindead that whenever naytiri hits him in the forehead and calls him a child i wanted to join her but instead just punch him yes i get the fact they wanted to show a transformation but this extremelydumbasaboxofrocks was so hard to watch it shouldve been played by keanu reeves who might have given him more depth as a surferdudewould i recommend it for special effects and fantastic sceneryscope alone and the inevitable ewoks finale made up for a lot of the movies downfalls obviously the general movie public or in this case the entire earth likes familiarity i on the other hand like to be amazed by screenplays that took more than a few hours to constructeither way i would recommend if you would ever see it you need to see it on the big screen i did and i am thankful now that i did and saw little to no depth i can safely save money on foreseeable future avatar sequels,negative
38,doc_39,well this is the event movie of the year i guess its currently on the rounds making shed loads of money its huge success i think is down to the clever idea of presenting it in 3d meaning that it is seen as a very cinematic experience ie you have to pay to go see it admittedly the cgi is very impressive and the 3d effects are integrated in a surprisingly subtle way there is a distinct lack of gimmicky 3d effects that are designed to make the viewer jump this is a sensible approach in my opinion as such things really only serve to take the viewer out of the film so james cameron has to be commended for his restraint here i do have to say at this point however that i am hardly a cgi fanatic i am in fact incredibly unexcited when i hear a film has amazing cgi it just doesnt interest me very much that said it did seem obvious to me that the effects here were pretty impressive so if thats your thing then this film will very possibly rock your boatwhile the effects are groundbreaking the same cannot be said of everything else the story is trite beyond belief its ridiculously predictable the sort of thing youve seen a hundred times before its amazing to me that cameron took years out to make this movie yet could not think of anything storywise than only the most overused clichés after about an hourandahalf once i had had my fill of the alien world i started to find it almost impossible to care what happened to these blue catpeople they were so tediously worthy that i began to think that the gungho army guys might have a point completely unreasonable of me i know but there you have it avatar temporarily turned me into a warmonger cheers cameroneven as i am writing this review i realise that it is one of the most pointless things i will ever do as only a month after avatars release it already has amassed over reviews on the imdb alone so the chances of anyone actually ever even reading what i have written above is close to nonexistent sigh,negative
39,doc_40,avatar isnt by any means a great movie but it is a stunningly beautiful one the design of the alien creatures and alien landscape is superb a fully realized world of great beautytake away that stunning beauty and youve got an okay but unexceptional action flick the story is bythenumbers a clichéd noblesavage vs evil empire script that is wellintentioned but unoriginal still the movie moves quickly the action is engaging and the experience is ultimately shallow but satisfyingim not sure how i feel about the 3d aspect sure its the best ive seen in terms of 3d technology i havent seen a 3d movie in many years but im not sold on 3d yet i kind of feel this movie would be just as pretty flat and that often the 3d effect was a little distracting but it may just be something im not used to,positive
40,doc_41,so what do i mean when i say i eat my words well it annoyed me that the fact that james cameron was the sole reason to see avatar yes hes a renowned director but i dont even consider him in the same league as a spielberg or a scorcese not that i am a huge fan of scorcese personally i didnt quite understand the visionary everyone thought he was yes hes done some solid actionscifi flicks and yes he managed to direct titanic to record breaking greatness but was this enough to base avatar solely on well i miss the titanic of boats because james camerons decade long labor of love might be at the very least one of the great film epics ever made hands down if nothing else avatar is the most visually stunning piece of film you will ever see and i didnt see it in 3d yet as many have said the cgi in the film which is practically of the entire film is nearly flawless and the work put into the navi people especially the main characters is just amazing add in the fact that there are some genuinely incredible performances and an entire world built from the ground up and scifi lovers will be floored this creation it still wont be the type of film to reach out to all genres but it is quite possibly one of the best movies i have ever seensam worthington is quickly becoming someone to watch for in hollywood he leads the cast in avatar with skill and a brooding personality unfortunately for him worthington is not the strongest in this cast he does well and yet his character doesnt have nearly the depth of some of the others still this should do amazing things for his future zoe saldana on the other hand is mind blowingly brilliant she gives the performance of her career and does it all behind the shadow of a cgi character proving that talent and brilliance can shine through even in voice and computer capture her character shows so much incredible emotion and is so brilliant she should be given an oscar just for those merits alone she is stunning sigourney weaver slips back into scifi brilliance as dr grace augustine she goes through a range of personality changes but is definitely a character you can feel empathy for yes she also smokes in the movieplease get over it its a character flaw millions smoke and just as a side note this woman who is a lovely fifty nine years oldlooks incredible stephen lang gives us a performance that just may be one of the great film villains of all time first of all he simply looks bad ass second of all he gives a strong surly performance that admittedly is a little two dimensional get the irony he serves his purpose as evil villain and pulls it off amazingly michelle rodriguez giovanni ribisi amazing cameo role joel moore great character actor and the entire cast that play the supporting navi characters are all brilliant in their own way some stand out more than others but the entire cast comes together perfectlyi just always though director and writer james cameron had a run of good luck with titanic and his earlier works in aliens and true lies and creating the terminator world but when you look at his body of work hes never done a bad movie the man knows science fiction and avatar has really been his thesis his ultimate show and he accomplished it in a big way maybe im over hyping the film but its just been a really long time since i was riveted to my seat transported like this film did for me in the theater make me want to see it again the moment the credits wrapped if you are one of the people who has not contributed to the billion dollar take i suggest you get out there and add to it because this film deserves to be film of all time i cant go right out there and say my favorite of all time yet but top five at the very least lets face it titanic was your grandmas moviethis one is for us you are king of the world mr cameronthe world and pandora and then someadditionfebruary 5th2010 i had the pleasure of seeing avatar for a second time and saw it in 3d was it impressive yes the technology is very impressive and looks cool did it change the entire face of the movie sorry folksit didnt for me the movie is incredible but its incredible because its avatar not because of the 3d im glad i saw it and it was on an imax screen so it was explosively cool but the movie is great on its own and gains very very little in 3d except a lot of depth,positive
41,doc_42,beastly epic scifi war drama fantasy lol beautiful shots and mesmerizing scenes one of the most visually stunning movies of all time and as the first big 3d movie it was groundbreaking lots of moving scenes and i am able to relate to the plight of the blue people about viewings,positive
42,doc_43,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning when his scientist brother dies crippled marine jake sully sam worthington becomes his stand in for his extensive knowledge of his brothers plans this puts him in the firing line of draugustine sigourney weaver and her team for his lack of scientific knowledge as they try and mould a way for humans to enter the world of the navi the indigenous people of a planet that col quaritch stephen lang and businessman parker selfridge giovanni ribisi want to conquer for personal gain as sully forms a close alliance with neytiri zoe saldana a female navi warrior and begins to be accepted by the rest of the clan it becomes a battle between ethics and power humanity and evil and a climactic battle to end it alljames cameron has to keep going and making the most expensive film ever made what with terminator true lies and most recently like recently titanicand now his latest avatar stretching at just under three hours again has gone and gained the accolade again as well as becoming the fastest grossing film of all time some people always have to do bigger and better but the two dont go hand in hand that often luckily as a filmic experience in itself avatar will stay memorable for a whilesince the effects are the main thing thats making it it has to be seen in 3d which you will note has improved greatly over the years to where it can still be seen perfectly without the special glasses but wearing them really does improve the experience to where you really do feel yourself being sucked from your seat into the world of the film itself but note the effects are what make the film such an amazing unforgettable experience surely enough the massive hype has seen the film sprung up to number on the imdb top which is low if you remember where the dark knight went but i think people need to step back and see things more clearly all i noticed aside from the effects were a lot of trite dialogue thin characterization and long meaningless stretches some have tried to make the film out to be some sort of study of the cruel destructive nature of humans but i noticed nothing so dramatic driving the film the performances hardly make things any better worthington interchangeable from his role in terminator salvation and lang and ribisi rather cardboard villains the female cast actually make it better saldana highly emotive as the navi warrior and weaver impassioned as the scientist with a heartyes if you look beneath the surface there are a lot of weaknesses in the fundamentals of the film but as a breath taking special effects spectacle cameron has gone and done it again giving us a blast of million dollar magic that are part of making a film such a wonderous experience for this reason alone it really cannot be missed on the big screen in the best 3d screen you can find,positive
43,doc_44,i must admit the film had me at the very beginning when a paraplegic says that he loves to dream because dreams make running and walking possible my head keeps nodding as if it was mounted on springs and the emotional outcome of that moment occurs when the marine jake sully sam worthington wakes up in his avatars new skin and doesnt feel any weirdness hes just so happy he starts to run as if he was in a dream as if nothing mattered anymore not even the mission i loved that moment because it felt surreal yet so real sully wouldnt have cared about looking like jarjar binks if it made him feel his toes again youssa better believe itand this might be camerons way to tell us that even something as big as avatar started as a tiny dream and the first images with the hybrid navis might have inspired him the same eccstatic reaction than sully his babies were alive in synthetic images but alive nonetheless now maybe its because avatar involves a giant alien species but the film is so cinematically big that it doesnt just dwarf other movies it dwarfs any attempt to criticize it on the sole basis that the plot carries many déjà vu feelings you see me coming but come on who the hell am i to say this movie is a retread of pocahontas dances with wolves or princess mononoke james cameron himself admitted to have made the story out of several inspiration and that included his childhood books and his mothers dreams was titanic any more original yet it made cameron the king of the world avatar turned him into an undisputed emperor and the film was so unique inventive in the concept and innovative in the treatment that it flies over the criticthats not to say you cant criticize it but the amount of things worthy of praise is so overwhelming critics would be like complaining that the sphinx misses a nose so i guess id feel better if i gave avatar ten points already and then talk about the eventual little things thatcouldhavebeenbetter so lets go i still remember how big avatar was in the last film to be as big without belonging to the star wars franchise was titanic so since this was from the same director people knew they were going to be blown away before swallowing the first popcorn and they were yes the film is marvelously looking but its cgi i loved it as far as i can appreciate a good pixar movie but reading roger eberts reviews i felt like he loved the film on the sole basis that it created a whole new world and that it didnt matter that the film didnt break any narrative groundnow does it matter not really i also praised titanic while it wasnt the most original story ever but it had characters i cared for and worthy antagonists there was a moment in avatar where the scientist played by sigourney weaver was describing the power of trees the way they use their roots as a synapses and so on which can be a rationalization for the trees magical power in pocahontas this part had me intrigued and involved but then ribisis character had to ruin it by saying there are just goddamn trees i was baffled by his lack of empathy its just as if they wanted to supply his mouth with some villains dialogue and the same awkward attempts were made with the captain of the mission played by stephen langbasically you have the good natives who behave exactly like extraterrestrial natives and you have the good and the bad white and in the role of lieutenant john smith dunbar theres worthington the film recycled so many plots elements that its difficult to disconnect your clichéradar but if the radar doesnt work how about forgetting about the story and listening to the dialogue the new language cameron invented by pulling a tolkien watching the little details in the scenery yes yes cgi but what cgi were not talking about any computer imagery this is a vision that kept on camerons mind since before titanic and he waited for the technological advances to make them possible even the king of the world was disarmed but he wisely waited for the right time and it became the highestgrossing film of all time any good team of computer programmers could have done it the film is a feast to the eyes its a deep story but i was reminded that there were more than special effects to make a film avatar might not be a triumph of storytelling but it doesnt have a bad story to tell its environmentalist issues the way they foreshadow our future needs echo some masterpieces from miyazaki in fact i kept thinking of mononoke while watching the film now is the film less worthy of praise because one was drawn lets say i prefer the way theres no villains in mononoke but to camerons defense the film couldnt have had another third act and lets acknowledge the creative force behind the very concept of the avatar and the beauty of the navis cameron created a world a myth he stole george lucas thunder and proved that cinema wouldnt just rely on star wars and then on comicbook movies the man had guts vision and the guts to follow his vision and he also had the dough you refuse nothing to the king of the world but if all it took to make great movies was money blockbusters would never flop avatar was deemed to succeed because it was a game changer and as far as critics go the game is over,positive
44,doc_45,its worth noting at the start that for nearly ten years avatar was the highest grossing film of all time therefore you may think that it has to be worth watching because so many people obviously did yes its certainly a technical achievement writerdirector james cameron usesrefines every special effect trick in the book and even invents a few new ones to bring us a science fiction tale about humanity trying to make peace with an alien race on a far away world in order to get a rare mineral found only on this planetits a decent enough tale but i cant help think that its extraordinary performance at the box office was largely due to being the first film in the modern 3d age the film is definitely live action but so many computergenerated special effects were required to create the giant blue aliens and their planet that half of it could practically be described as a bigger budget pixar moviesam worthington is the star a disabled space marine who gets a second lease of life with legs by inhabiting an avatar which is basically a humanbuilt version of the giant blue aliens once in control of this avatar he can then mingle with the tribe and hopefully get them to trade their precious supply of unobtanium no seriously thats what they call this rare material sigourney weaver is about the biggest name on the cast list but she seems to be playing a character whos a long way from her most famous onscreen incarnation ie ripley from aliens here she wants to preserve the alien way of life rather than nuking the site from orbitalthough i never saw it in the cinema i heard it was definitely an impressive watch simply because of the outstanding 3d and various effects its still worth a watch on the small screen but in terms of story it really is nothing new you can pretty much tell whats going to happen right from the off and everyones character is quickly defined as either good or bad also theres also very heavy political messages not particularly skilfully woven into the story the piece does get kind of preachy and its strange that a writer as skilful as james cameron cant find way of putting his own politics a little more subtly than what we end up withif youre looking for a scifi action film that wont tax your brain that much you could certainly do much worse there are great effects action setpieces and a story thats believable if you dont think too hard about it i do always wonder why a film as successful as this never really seemed to linger much in popular culture no one really talks about it much any more leaving me to wonder whether it really was just the novelty of the 3d aspect that sold it to the masses i guess well see when the sequels start rolling out,positive
45,doc_46,my impressions after having seen avatar are mixedon one hand i am the kind of film viewer who does not run away from entering the film theater and expecting a greaterthanlife experience i also love computer effects and any special effects that extend the cinema experience from this point of view james camerons film is one of the best that i have seen maybe second only to peter jacksons last film in the lord of the rings series in creating a whole new world of fascinating beauty in imagining shapes colors and visual emotions that did not exist beforei also am a big science fiction fan i love third degree encounters and i let easily the small or tall green or blue aliens move and frighten me yet when judging a science fiction story or film i use the same criteria as when judging any other story or film the capacity of entertaining of creating emotion and of making me think here i think avatar is no more than an average movie considered beyond the visuals it is no more than a quite banal action film with stereotype characters human or alien with an anticolonial message that is routine having seen it in scores of films from the tarzan and john wayne movies to the latest iraq films and with new age incantations that never convinced me in any film everthe 3d genre is not so new i have actually seen a 3d film festival in a cinematheque a decade ago and it was made up mainly by action and science fiction films of the 50s the technology was amazingly similar based on the two colors plastic spectacles i find it remarkable that film makers took this technique out of the dusty drawers and made it enhance the other new film effects invented since films will however be judged by most people by the emotions they generate my feelings after seeing avatar are that i viewed a fine visual show but that it was deprived of originality and depth despite the 3d visuals a dimension was still missing,neutral
46,doc_47,avatar is the new feat of filmmaking i would never have though james cameron would have been able to pull this off especially after all the hype its safe to say he did while the plot is similar to other films and despite many reviews saying that its screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film i disagree its true that the screenplay is simple but i found that is was a lot better than titanics screenplay which really turned me off but like most said the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film in a good way it sets off this whole new vision that cameron wants to bring to us he does magnificently the creature designs visuals sound colors and depth that everything has in pandora is amazing and i have never been transported into another world like i have with avatar seeing it in 3d was spectacular simply spellbinding and unforgettable everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film and for that james cameron has succeeded very well he is a great director and i hope he gets nominated for the oscar at the very least avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment it is one of the best films of and one of the best action films ever made,positive
47,doc_48,arguably the most visually impressive movie i have ever seen featuring perhaps the best cgi ever put to film this feastfortheeyes proves what you can do with the right amount of money time and passion avatar wows today almost as much as it did back when it was first released its also worth noting that it represents one of the only times 3d has enhanced an experience with even the homevideo release sporting great depthenhancing effects and a general emphasis on bringing you into its world rather than forcing it out at you the story may be lacking in originality the characters are somewhat generic and it is certainly too long but the breathtaking sights and fantastic action make this an enjoyable ride that should be experienced by all fans of cinema,positive
48,doc_49,after more than a decade james cameron makes quite a returns with avatar the idea of john smith meeting pocahontas at a moon is quite intriguing camerons pandora is fascinating to look at the last time i saw a fictitious place this spectacular was in hayao miyzakis spellbinding mononoke himethe cgi designs especially of the jungle and its inhabitants are intricately detailed and pleasantly colourful even though the stop motion is still prominent needless to say on the technical front pretty much everything from action sequences soundtrack sound effects to cinematography are brillianthowever avatar isnt without its share of flaws especially where the writing is concerned considering that its an epic film a formulaic story is expected with lots of battle sequences romance etc but cameron introduces certain themes but he doesnt really go anywhere with them an example is graces theory about the trees communicating through synapses like the human brain or perhaps cameron left this open for a possible sequel moreover there are a few plot holes how come all the animals with the exception of the horselike creatures are predators how come the navi speak such good english the acting is fairly good however sam worthingtons performance isnt exactly flawless his acting is flat in a few sequences but in other he manages to make it work giovanni ribisis villain is formulaic but its refreshing to see him do something different for a change and he does it well zoe saldana is impressive as pocahontas i mean neytiri sigourney weaver and michelle rodriguez are first rateoverall avatar is visually pleasing and entertaining as flawed as it may be its a much more exhilarating film than camerons horrendous candyfloss called titanic,neutral
49,doc_50,this movie was better than i expected because i thought the story would be horrible and it wasnt actually its a story that has been used many times it sort of reminded me of general custard at little big horn the bad humans are tired of trying to make nice with the blue aliens and so decide to destroy them aliens with their less advanced weapons unite and defeat the bad humans from completely overtaking their worldsigourney weaver plays grace a scientist that wants to learn from the navi and believes that they are one with the forest enter jake a marine whom is replacing his deceased brother as a driver of an avatar which is the humanalien body that can be controlled by the humans mind jake gets lost and is taken in by the navi in particular a girl neytiri they teach him the way of life he is supposed to gain their trust and ask them to leave their land so the humans can harvest this valuable rock that is thereof course jake falls for the girl and wants to help them defend their land against the evil chief of security whom takes over and wants to destroy everythingfinal verdict its your typical story that everyone likes plus cool special effects it is a little long but thats why i say watch it at home so you can stop it several times,positive

51,doc_52,this movie features a guy named jake using another body to become a species of alien called the navi to help colonize a moon he turns against the people who order its destruction this was the highest grossing movie in the world up until avengers endgame although in the united states it was first surpassed by star wars episode vii the force awakens its easily the highest grossing film thats based on a completely original story most people only remember the visualsthe film has gotten some criticism for not being original with the story being done in films like pocahontas and dare i say district i really do get the relationship between jake and his mate i admit that the general villain is very bland sigourney weaver might be the best actoractress maybe because its time she dealt with less hostile aliens we of course get amazing visuals and its silly to complain about the military being defeated because they had a whole moons worth of natives to help and the spirit of nature itself its long but the setup is done at a great pace,positive
52,doc_53,years ago james cameron had a vision of avatar in mind a vision so ahead of its time that cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up a vision so imaginative exciting that he finally went on to create the much needed technology on his own and the end result was not disappointing at all avatar takes filmmaking technology to a whole new level sets a new standard in 3d viewing its a milestone in the history of the artavatar tells the story of jake sully a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders protecting the world he feels is his home avatar is primarily an actionadventure journey of selfdiscovery in the context of imperialism biodiversity avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world so watch it in 3d cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of camerons worlddirector james cameron has once again broken all boundaries created a visual extravaganza thus in the process announcing his return which just couldnt have been better from terminator to aliens to the abyss to terminator to titanic now avatar the entertainment scope is getting wider wider with every camerons film without compromising at all with the quality the attention he has given to the detail is superb not only cameron created a whole new world with its flora fauna of exceptional beauty he went on to create the culture race language of the navi too their love for their surroundings they are to pandora what humans are to earth only difference being our ignorance to our surroundingsavatar isnt an exceptional movie overall when it comes to plot performances or dialogs its a disappointment those things are no match to camerons previous works terminator aliens terminator even titanic the reason behind avatar breaking every boxoffice records lies in the beauty of avatar thats drawing people to theaters again again the unforgettable experience in 3d viewing the deadend beauty of pandora the neverseenbefore filmmaking technology much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success it has started the change it has set things in motion cinema is getting revolutionized almost every movie is going 3d these days because of avatar still none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience thats why avatar is way ahead of its timenow lets come to the strong points of avatar it lies in its visual effects editing cinematography editing like any cameron movie is brilliant the cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment the exotic creatures incredibly lifelike natives of pandora those who watched it in 3d knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora fauna of pandora however the backbone of avatar is its visual effects groundbreaking from scene its not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which visual effects of avatar reached new heights worlds greatest visual effects studios ilm weta digital worked together to produce this gem and the results are wonderful the attention in detailing the magnitude scale of pandora are sure to leave viewers jawdropped just the detailing on the face of a navi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its makingtechnically avatar is a breakthrough in filmmaking technology 3d viewing stereoscopic filmmaking with camera being designed specifically for the movie if one looks at the story it isnt that bad too of course not the best or even among the best but still it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world thats what this movie is doing right now at least james cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie unlike michael baytransformers n or roland emmerich2012 godzilla etc who rely only on vfx nothing else at least avatar scores pretty well above them it tells a fine story let vfx n sfx take this movie to new heightsjames horner collaborated with james cameron for the 3rd time after titanic aliens no doubt has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again the score is not as epic as titanic but is still excellent for a scifi film the score is really beautiful succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race the beauty of the music of avatar blends well with the beauty of pandora james horner has done a fantastic jobalso the story or screenplay of avatar wont make it to the great lists so its better you go without expecting a quality plot screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes and make sure you watch avatar in 3d for an all new experience you wont regret it missing avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema so be a part of it1010 for avatars beauty the wonderful experience i had in theater,positive

54,doc_55,avatar 2009technically dizzying morally unambiguous with dialog and a story line aimed at teens and young adults but clearly with wider appeal set a hundred and some years in the future the helicopters landing still conjure up vietnam and some of the big mean soldier stuff drinking coffee in the middle of battle with the airships rolling in over the population below is pure apocalypse now its a big movie and visually demanding the 3d is terrific smoother and more restrained than other 3d releases journey to the center of the earth which gives it sophistication beyond just the gimmick i watched part of if without the glasses and its actually still pretty jazzy so i think it would work in 2d very well if thats what you have in your area or in your budgetthey charge extra for the extra dimension the music is heart pumping stuff formulaic for sure but part of the adrenalin machineis this a good movie not really its an impressive movie obviously but it has a hyped up computer gaming feel to it not only visually but ethically and in terms of depth of plot it does have a science fiction fascination to it with the mind and soul switching bodies in different ways though im not totally sure it makes logical sense which even scifi has to do and the clichés are fun in their own ways even if i got tired of it all the constant running and fear the endless platitudes the constantly pretty prettiness its one heck of a beautiful planet pandora is even more of a problem is the stereotyping going on culturally from the natives to the military but ill save getting angry for another day if you notice it its demeaning if you dont watch it againthese arent all things to hate but the movie doesnt have a lot to love nothing to dig into nothing to think about nothing to make you feel deeply it might make you feel in a more sympathetic waythere is room for a lot of sympathy and if your heart strings are dangling bewarebut it will do so in the way the lion king or pocahontas did someone said to me hearing my doubts you expect too much and that makes me think really id hate to ever say that about a movie this ambitious even from a james cameron who already proved his crowd pleasing intentions and savvy with titanic expectations aside i want more and you might tooi added this response to the new york times blog after a comment by their reviewer manohla dargis well yes its sort of given that we all carry our baggage with us and apply our viewpoints with bias one way or the other but dargis is too willing to just say whatever as if the movie didnt have some specific narrative and symbolic qualities that can be scrutinized that is even if viewers come away from the movie with a diversity of views hopefully they do it is still true that the main character is a white male with a disability or that there are almost no african representations among the humans and few women two mainly and they both die or that there is a kind of broad stereotyping of the natives in attitude and appearance widely open to interpretation but not a blank slate or that the invading traitor ends up being voila the leader of this hapless tribal people with very high ideals etc etc if it sounds like im suggesting a way to read the movie its not on purpose thats the baggage thing and i have mine but it doesnt mean that we should all just turn a blind eye to the possibilities without polarizing the argument and without making the movie more than it is a dizzying entertainment a step away from some disney classics with all their stereotyping,neutral
55,doc_56,i dont think that ill like avatar that much if i see it again and its not in 3d the visual experience was fun but i really had no strong emotional connection to the characters or the story or the trees for that matter the special effects are great but beyond that it is just a cookiecutter plot,neutral
56,doc_57,as a prolific reviewer here i have on many occasions encountered what i call first release shock essentially a film so offthebeatenpath so unique so different that instead of appreciating it for what it is initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watchingthis film is the poster child for that syndrome on its own it is one of the most daring best written best acted best sfxd films of all time it comes from a man cameron who is known for blockbusters but this is easily his greatest workthis film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system but as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it and the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectationsit is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts the job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it see it six or seven times it just gets better one of the greatest films of all time and also timeless,positive
57,doc_58,in the future humans have traveled to the far reaches of the universe on a planet called pandora a very important new element was discovered one that is very valuable but wouldnt you know the natives on the planet live in the forest where most of the element is located underground it is the human intention to displace the natives out of their woods and get to the mineral for years the americans have occupied an outpost on the planet and have tried peaceful methods to reason with the aliens the top scientist grace sigourney weaver learned their language and opened a school to teach the native children english and the ways of the human but the pandoran population truly wants none of it for they rightly feel that their world will be destroyed although they have only bows and arrows with a killing poison attached they are very fierce as a last resort the marines are trying a program of elaborate robots where an earthling goes into a sort of capsule and sleeps while his soul inhabits a native body it is their hope that learning the ways of the natives will make them easier to conquer and move now a wheelchairbound marine named jake scully sam worthington gets a new pandoran body and goes with grace and a few others on a mission but due to some fierce dinosaurlike creatures jake becomes separated from the others and is left in the forest at night grace believes he will surely die he would have too for a powerful female warrior neytiri zoe saldana was set to shoot him but some seeds from their tree of life cover jake and neytiri sees it as an omen she takes jake back to her village where he is eventually accepted as a tribesman he learns to ride the native horses and dragons he and neytiri also fall in love but during the night jake reports back to the marines when his native body is asleep the marine commander believes he is gathering information to defeat the primitive folk as one might guess jake soon realizes his new people are very worthy and should not be destroyed or moved for their life is connected deeply to the forest their home what will jake do to save neytiri and his new brothers and sisters this is an amazing film a stunningly visual panorama that has to be seen to be believed the planet of pandora is a forest like no other with plants that glow and creatures that resemble dinosaurs wolves and dragons the natives too resemble the american indian and other earthly tribes such as the residents of the amazon rain forests most importantly they are attached to their planet as the native americans were to the earth when they kill an animal for food they utter prayers to the animal for giving his life so that they might be sustained they consider the destruction of any plant a blow to their own bodies thus in many respects the movie is a gigantic homage to the american indian and their way of life wes studi who was the ultra frightening native american in the last of the mohicans even plays the pandoran leader but enough of this the actors including worthington weaver saldana ribisi stephen lang and all of the rest do a fine job the dialogue and story are perhaps not totally original but quite quite adequate however even all these take a back seat to the incredibly imaginative scope of the films setting a new world far away it is the grand scale of the forested planet that will take a viewers breath away in short dear film fan see it absolutely if you can go to only one film this year or next make it avatar it is truly a jawdropping work that will overwhelm most anyone with its visionary beauty,positive

59,doc_60,avatarthroughout history explorers colonizing foreign shores usually brought items of interest with them to trade with the indigenous people be it guns for tobacco alcohol for pelts or christianity for personal freedom however the only thing that the subjugated populace in this scifi film received upon the arrival of their oppressors was annihilationwhen paraplegic marine jake sam worthington substitutes for his twin brother on a mission to the planet pandora his legs are restored when his minds transferred into an avatar of a navi a blueskinned nativeordered to infiltrate the hostiles camp and relay information concerning a massive mineral deposit things go awry when jake falls for the tribe leaders daughter neytiri zoe saldana as well as her primitive lifestyle torn between military obligations and personal ethics jake must pick a side in the war between the persecutors and the persecutedconceived by james cameron avatar is a mindblowing experience and while the story of going native is old hat the ecofriendly premise and the cgi used to bring the jungle surroundings to life are unparalleledbut in the end whos to say if the navi wouldnt benefit under imperialism i mean have they ever even heard of american apparel green light,neutral
60,doc_61,visually james camerons sf spectacle will leave you breathless especially in the 3d version on the big screen on that side even ten is not enough but essentially the film provides nothing new the whole story is so unoriginal and full of hollywood clichés bordering pathetic that from that angle i couldnt stretch to more than four recommended for watching with children provided they have an attention span for a three hours movie710,positive
61,doc_62,greetings from lithuania2 years have past since avatar blow out the cinemas in this dying world years have past since we visited pandora for our first time in these two years nothing nothing in this world came even in a mile to avatars experience and im a real fan of inception james cameron is my favorite director since his aliens i simply love every single movie except the one with flying fishes killers he made im waited for avatar from the moment i first heard about jcameron making his new groundbreaking movie since titanic it was in in december of avatar blew out everything never in my life i didnt saw anything like that before and i saw almost everything in local 3d theater in was impossible to have a ticket everyone talked only about this experience in theatersrecently i revisited pandora on blu ray on my m x m hd screen its a breathtaking ride,positive
62,doc_63,december the technology is almost here and avatar and director cameron has almost created the perfect vehicle for the future of film minus the real actors this americanfocused popularized and simplified version of the blockbuster scifi movie appears to the fusion of various popular movies plus super cgi this movie is essentially dances with wolves with an american ending put into space along with a aliens military backgroundcorporate scenario robocop star troopers jurrasic park iii along with fantasy series dragonriders of pern written by anne mccaffery with musical strains from enemy at the gates what this spectacularly looking movie misses is the consistency of cultural immersion found in dances with wolves especially the native language and the inconsistent adoption by lead character jake sully of its language and its holistic mindset cameron allows the americanization and oversimplification of the politically correct presentation of american evilness there is one scene midway where jake is able to meld with one of the local inhabitants and then says incorrectly youre mine as opposed to were together now which would have been much more in line with the native perspective of living things there were also a few technical weaknesses consisting of machine guns which one would have assumed would have advanced in over a hundred years and the climatic action scene were supposedly bullet still using them proof glass conveniently breaks when it comes to the enemys troop carriers overall however this is a breakthrough movie that immerses the audience into another world almost seamlessly the level of technology and special effects almost almost is imperceptible to live action yet it is the small details that seem to deflect this movie from becoming truly a classic movie,positive
63,doc_64,the female lead neytiri voiced and motion capture by actress zoe saldana was kinda right the world that director james cameron made was definitely worth seeing at the time the mixing of live action with photo realistic cgi really work so well with very few fake looking scenes the vibrant planet with its motion capture blue skinned navi characters were quite beautiful and breathtaking with its floating mountains wing creatures and neon glowing plant life nevertheless the main story about a human soldier jake sully sam worthington torn between his military orders to find a rare natural resource and his love for the native people didnt live up to the eye candy visuals the main plot didnt feel that unique it was too similar to clichés from best picture oscar winner film dances with wolves mixed with disney animation movie pocahontas with bits from ferngully the last rainforest cartoon motion picture to add onto that the whole earth mother indigenous people allegory message felt a little too heavy handed and preachy for a popcorn escapism film it really does make you feel the blues about trying to enjoy yourself for only a few hours that films message is also somewhat hypocritical in a way as the flick was later oversaturation with a large amount of consumerist tie ins after all they did clear acres of swamp land to build a theme park attraction based on this movie due to greed thats a lot of home trees certainly not conservationism actions at all from somebody that once stop the construction of a proposed dam in brazil also the whole idea of deus ex machina eywa coming alive in the end for jake sully felt a little forced seeing how he isnt originally from their world its like saying a wellfunded new age hippie from the city is more in line with mother nature rather than the native americans that lived there its kinda an insult its also weird that he was chosen over dr grace augustine sigourney weaver whom spent her own life trying to protect the navi regardless i did dig the whole operation of walking in somebody shoes with the genetically engineered body subplot it reminds me so much of the avatars of the blue deities in hinduism and their belief of reincarnation because of that we really got to learn the tribes culture but also with that the awkwardly somewhat disturbing alien hair like kama sutra bonding scene with other creatures nevertheless all the exploration of the navi didnt work to expose much of the individuals of the clan personalities besides neytiri i hardly remember any of those characters nobody stood out from their overall stereotypical noble savage ways as for the human characters sam is alright in the role even if his characters paraplegic subplot doesnt add much he was a bit cookie cutter yet its stephen lang as colonel quaritch giovanni ribisi as parker selfridge as the over the top villains that really stood out for me lots of well delivered memorable lines from these two actors even if their dialogue was a bit cheesy i especially love the action scenes involving the colonel the mask on shoot out and the nonchalantly way he puts himself out after catching on fire was certainly badass while a lot of people are saying that the film is pushing an antiamerican militarism message with its imperialism depictions of the space marine the main different is in real life the groups responsible for committing the most war crimes against humanity are not the american occupying soldiers but those extremists domestic to the area especially in what happening in afghanistan and iraq still i do see some similarities what happening in the film with the search for unobtainium what happening in our world with oil along with the phrase winning the hearts and minds regardless of that the music composed by james horner and singer leona lewis does take you out of the real world into one full of adventure and wonder yet the sound effects for this movie doesnt sound otherworldly much of the noises for the creatures in this film does seem recycled from other blockbuster flicks like jurassic park its a bit annoying as for the humanoid aliens sounds like a car alarm dont really give off the idea that theyre living beings just saying in the end this flick became one of the highest grossing films of all time surpassing camerons previous movie titanic until finally beaten by the russo brothers comic book masterpiece avengers endgame ten years later much of this was aided by higher ticket prices for 3d screenings because of that success studios became to request post production conversion into 3d for some of their films although the success rate widely varied such in the case of the once titled avatar the last airbender that was universally panned by critics for how bad the flicks visuals was upon its release in the end very little post 3d films have match camerons success at the box office another thing avatar did good at was the home market release it pretty much help save bluray in the high definition optical disc format war the flick also scored a number of accolades with most of the wins involving the technology aspect of the film the movie had so much success and praise that its been reported that there will be sequels in the works being filmed back to back it will be interesting where they take the story from here whenever those flicks come out overall once in a blue moon a film come out that everybody has to see this is that movie its an epic watch one worth waking up to,positive
64,doc_65,in the future a paraplegic marines avatar a goofy blueskinned cartoonlike incarnation of himself that he controls while sleeping is sent on a mission to mingle with the natives of a distant planet the pictures are pretty but the story is a lame rehash of a theme that has been done much better before the movie becomes increasingly tedious as it lumbers along for nearly three hours cameron is not so much interested in making a compelling movie as in flaunting his prowess with special effects weavers presence only serves to remind one of how good a scifi film can be alien this nonsensical movie plays out like a dull computer game,negative
65,doc_66,with apologies to the great coach but it does seem that visual is the only thing in avatar given a plot that is simplicity itself and the unsubtlety of the allegory and messages even with the credible performance of a good cast i find the overwhelming reaction audience and critics alike somewhat puzzling roger eberts comparison of the new language to that in lotr in addition to demonstrating the gentlemans total ignorance tantamount to an unforgivable insult to jrr tolkienfirst on the visual after watching beowulf i was filled with absolute detestation at an abomination called motion capture the outright rude transformation of an actors real performance into an animation on screen is a technologyspawn sin that is surpassed by only one thing in human history the atomic bomb the obscenely glossy figures in that movie were positively vomitinducing that alone almost kept me away from avatar i am happy to say however that the motion captured characters therein are quite acceptable partly because cameron commands a better technology and partly because the motion captured characters are from an alien culture and therefore not expected to look exactly like the human race the 3d effect on the other hand is no more than an excuse to make me pay double for my ticket having seen what real 3d is supposed to be like some years ago at the epcot when it first opened i have found everything that ive seen since with that label nothing more then mere childs play avatar is no exceptionthe scifi basis for this movie is conceptually simple especially if you have seen surrogate when a protagonist is put into a state of deep sleep in a nottoosophisticatedlooking device his mind embodies a surrogate body going about whatever business at hand the only difference is that here in avatar the surrogate body is from an alien culture resembling in appearance human in some ways but not others what follows are familiar plot elements assimilation of an individual into a new culture a crossculture love story heroic uprising against oppressorsthe cast is well chosen and performs well sam worthington coming off terminator salvation plays a relatively younger hero especially in his alien persona one of his two roles unlike worthington zoe saldana his female colead has only one identity the passionate daughter of the alien chief those who have seen how beautiful she was in vantage point will be happy to know that even under the entirely alien appearance her beauty is not lost sigourney weaver who happens to have also appeared in vantage point is a welcome addition to any cast personally i am most happy to see my favourite giovanni ribisi prolific actor and best remembered acting opposite cate blanchett in heaven he plays a scientist rudely awaken to the reality that science is not the only thing not just an end in itself stephen land and michelle rodriguez complete the very respectable castavatar is a good movie but not a great one,neutral
66,doc_67,ah yes the greatest film ever made according to box office takings at least love it or hate it there is no denying this is pure brilliance the grand scale of the entire production is simply mind blowing the effects are unlike anything weve ever seen and is quite mesmerizing actually action adventure humor drama exhilarating action sequences and a world full of magic and color ensure entertainment deluxe add a brilliant cast and a credible hero in the form of sam worthington and i can easily see why this film became the highest earning film in movie history the tranquility of the avatar world gives us a sense of escapism and makes us wish we ourselves could plunge into this world of pure bliss and perfection our hero goes from paraplegic in the real world to a perfect being in the avatar world so why wouldnt we also want to escape into this awesome worldthe destruction of the big tree must be one of the most awesome scenes,positive
67,doc_68,this film was a true epic of its time it is definitely not very original in its storyline but it was so well executed that i was engrossed all the way through emotionally enraptured and always rooting for the characters other than the beginning you never notice how much time has passed it is visually wonderful although it relies on this a bit too much at the expense of the story the storyline and characters are a bit clichéd but it was just so engaging i didnt care,positive
68,doc_69,having just seen avatar i wanted to report the experience as it relates to entertainment rather than just expounding upon the wow factor there is no question that the special 3d effects are spectacular most movies make the story the primary form of entertainment with special effects taking a secondary role with avatar this sequence is completely reversed as the 3d effects overwhelm the simplistic story this brings me to the most glaring flaw with avatar if the storyline is deep and involving there is little problem with a film running minutes or even a little longer unfortunately avatar at minutes becomes redundant and ultimately somewhat disappointing because as wonderful as the effects are they cannot maintain interest for such an unrealistic time frame merk,positive
69,doc_70,this is just an over hyped overrated movie that put me to sleepduring the hype before watching this i expected to see something great i didnt the movie was so boring and so long it was a long boring movieits no wonder why the sequel or prequel has been delayed because the producers were probably bored with it and didnt expect fans to actually like such a boring movie and they were probably like do we really want to make another boring avatar movie they just made up excuses for its delaysnow that avatar is under disney ahahaha good luck,negative
70,doc_71,i am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film the special effects both visual and sound are superb sublime perfect the merger of star wars and matrix of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable james cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film two or three times if possible and james cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extraterrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higherups and greedy industrialists to list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages so i will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions i want to insist on the central message of the film both ideological and cultural americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species both intelligent and developed but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive the only aim of the americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main hometree of this species under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these americans have been fed genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod the problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization their culture their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political father and religious mother leaders of the tribe james cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the american side both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading receiving and experiencing these emotions we feel the full horror james cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide james cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extraterrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids both real and cloned but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind but it remains absolutely sublime the meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides it is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration cooperation exchange and even total gift of culture technological power natural knowledge spiritual representations and all other common or different domains in other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures salad bowl or melting pot integration or assimilation but james cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species understood as being the americans who have no word of honor when greed is in play at the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality religion and religious beliefs included we will only produce a genocide be it at least a cultural genocide teaching english and imposing our culture and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages the punishment of the tower of babel in our religious lore james cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable and he is in perfect line with the deepest judeochristian tradition of ours of the christ who was rabbi jesus before being crucified that deepest belief of ours is called love to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our enemies as much as our friends in other words and to cut short a long story this film is the first gospel after barack hussein obamas election even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in copenhagen the second gospel of this obama era will be the announced film by steven spielberg on the last novel by stephen king under the dome after saint james the first bishop of jerusalem and the elder brother of jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of

71,doc_72,when avatar first hit the theaters back in early december of i really didnt have an overwhelming urge to see it as im usually very skeptical of films that base their hype on cgi based graphics as they usually overshadow such important elements as plot and character development however with the film surpassing titanic as alltime in box office revenues i figured i would give it a shot thinking maybe i really was missing out on something special unfortunately the film did much much worse as i left the theater wondering how such a shallow movie could now be on top of the heapthe number one flaw in the film is one that it truly cannot recover from in any other aspect a terribly shallow plot if you have seen pocahontas white man must learn the ways of the natives or dances with wolves disgruntled military officer sympathizes with former enemy you have seen avatar there really is nothing elseadding to that fatal flaw is the highhanded directing of james cameron while some great directors clint eastwood immediately comes to mind here will present an interesting palette of characters and let the viewers decide what they may about them cameron instead chooses to be rigid in his character definition for example the military is evil scientists are greedy and all natives are perfect in their commune with nature if you have your head in the clouds then perhaps those kinds of moralist viewpoints will appeal to you for the rest of us it is quite sickening basically it turns into minutes of cameron slapping you across the face with his environmentalnaturalist themesthus as far as character development is concerned it practically does not exist besides the utterly predictable transformation of the one good white man and his assimilation into the native culture no other background is explored on any character i am fully confident that any decent writer could sit down and within a day put together a much more interesting backstory on certain aspects of the film military scientists etc that would actually make the conflicts of the film compelling other than the bleedingheart sap it turned out to beplus and this is truly the coupedegrace of failure the cgi produces some great images but unless you are a complete techhead it isnt really anything to fawn over for example the sinking of the titanic in camerons other big film was just as eyepopping as anything that avatar put up on the screento be honest it really makes me shake my head that a movie like this can not only succeed in this country but do so in record capacity have we really become so thoughtless and simple to reduce humanity to such blackandwhite constructs im sure that the academy award voters will have a field day with such themes and turn the ceremony into camerons own private ego massaging but i for one do not see it that way if you are looking for a great director who will really make you think about humanity try the later films of clint eastwood,negative
72,doc_73,i just finished watching this movie on dvd and it was incredible i agree with many of the critics and reviews this movie takes the art and creations to another level theres a lot of good feelings going on for this film and rightly so after a summer of lackluster crap along comes this magnificent film for once the hype was actually deserved i wont talk about the plot this film is best seen with as little information as possible i didnt really expect the creation and picture to be this great but it was unreal the picture truly is amazing i didnt expect the emotional impact but cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons and he does so here masterfullyi know there were many bad critics and some of them have reasons for hate most of them have criticisms of the plot some of the criticism lies in the surface quality of the plot but again cameron has never made deep cerebral films cameron is an entertainer and thank god for it this film is pure futuristic ahead of its time escapism i was absolutely floored it shows the world beyond a world its an outstanding journey and was a great thing to finally watch this film,positive
73,doc_74,millionplus big screen video game run amuck pretty much sums it up dont it cameron clearly a fan of robert heinlein starship troopers joe haldeman all my sins remembered and harlan ellison soldier demon with a glass hand has actually managed this time around to incorporate the last of the mohicans into his big screen video game hows that for juxtaposition unfortunately the end result is something less than satisfying unless of course you have the constitution to sit through a 3hourlong video game couched in the usual clichéd military setting which i dont on a somewhat related note i found out the hard way by first purchasing and then watching it that the directors cut of george lucass thx1138 had been tampered with spankin new cgi have been added that undercut the gritty realism that made the original version so much better there is at least one reference to a wookie being run over yukyuk and the inbred trolls who attack duvall at movies end have been replaced by unconvincing cgi monsters maybe one of these days filmmakers will learn to leave well enough alone but i doubt it,negative
74,doc_75,the moment in avatar you know the whole thing is a load of nonsense and is more preoccupied with all things visual is the moment the lead has a conversation with a superior clambering into a thirty foot tall robot amidst a hangar full of them what banal dialogue follows could have unfolded in an office or anywhere else but no its in a large hangar with lots of other stuff going on as well the pinch is right there the statement that cameron is more interested in delivering things as big and as brash as possible no matter how routine the actual detail going on therein is avatar is a plodding numbing stumbling fumbling chore of an experience a heavy wavy film which stomps from one thing to another in a selfreflective clumsily plotted manner all the while pandering to a crowd whom it seems are thick enough to fall in love with a picture if it quenches the attention span but additionally carries some kind of coherent narrative complete with light substance in short its a whole lot of fuss over absolutely nothing throughout the film certain winged creatures that can be flown around on have something plugged into them enabling their taming and under the riders control a similar process has happened to avatars fans theyve been caught retuned to writerdirector camerons vision and now theyre all dancing to his musictwelve years had past between 1997s titanic and avatar if another twelve goes by before cameron again graces the silver screen then it may well be too shorta time but the film covers the exploits of paraplegic american grunt jake sully worthington an individual who touches down on a jungleclad moon known as pandora in true platoon fashion what with the coming down of an aircraft the lowering of a ramp and the bleary eyed entrance into a world of violence and vegetation cameron shoots the new world through their eyes for our benefit exemplified by way of the distinct eyelevel point of view shot that we get of the marines jogging down off the aircraft for the first time a world just as strange and scary to him as it is to us with the odd buildings vehicles and general miseenscene that surrounds the base camp so were plunged into this guys shoes very early onavatar begins with jake waking up out a long period of space rest a fitting metaphorical rebirthing into a new world theres a lot of clumsy talk of birth and being reborn then all the build up of the locale begins local head of operations miles quaritch lang spends most of the film strutting around debriefing rooms barking dialogue also he lifts weights flexes his muscles sits on chairs the wrong way around in an attempt to intimidate and stomps about in large mechanical fighting units that act as an extension of his own power and masculinity his warnings of the location of pandora and of the things that lurk within see him make us aware of an off screen threat an attempt to build pressure and an aura of both mystery and danger there are things that can kill you and that are tough to kill he informs as the horrid scars of his own day one here act as a further reminder of the dangers the principle threat is from the navi a tall blue alien speciesthen there is the location the lush and dense location of pandora a mixture of the jungles of east asia with what its like being in some of the more larger greenhouses at the site of londons kew gardens people have come away awe struck their defences of the film have revolved around the effects and the visual factor but slap the film on a television screen in two dimensions and maybe have it play out in black and white and you and your argument would be lost as theres barely anything to support the visuals indeed theres a sequence when one character is piloting a craft with another and exclaims oh my god in sheer awe at whats around him in what is a truly dopey knowing moment this time on what the audience reaction ought to be to the same sight camerons retort is you should see the look on your faces but the look on mine was of a frownjake gets lost on pandora so much so that after weve had a little interaction with some native beasties skull island style zoe saldanas native moon dwelling navi girl neytiri bumps into him with intent to put a poisonous arrow through him hark a floating jellyfishcomedandelion lands on the nib and saves him it s a sign hes a chosen one and camerons soft storytelling makes itself painfully known when jake meets her everything on pandora lights up the plants glow and the intimidating atmosphere vanishes foreshadowing the connection they have and the arc of their relationshipthe wouldbe allconquering american tyrant figure of quaritch a man gunning for his unobtanium supply located within is nothing more than a dopey parable while towards the end i was distracted its a wonder the navi arent already extinct as theyve barely anything to eat spend most of their time leaping from branch to branch a mile up purely to journey somewhere else and they go on cliff side suicide missions in trying to tame flying beasts i can imagine the tongueincheek onset conversations cameron had with worthington over the recent terminator sequel debacle being more interesting than most of avatar a film that has burrowed its way into its audiences subconscious in that the lead leaves his current existence to become someonething else much like you leave your real existence and become someonething else when booting up a video game avatar exists to sell action figures and pandora themed top trumps playing cards i agree that avatar was spectacular a spectacular disappointment,neutral
75,doc_76,a lot of mystery was created around this movie since the very first years of production this was the first movie of james cameron since he made the successful film which i hated titanic i wasnt sure what to expect especially after seeing the first reviews which compared this film with revolutionary works as star wars fortunately i wasnt disappointed of what i saw avatar is much much better than titanic probably it received more hype than it actually deserved but it was a funny exciting adventure basically as many users said before it is a futuristic version of dances with wolves with some elements of pocahontas and ferngully sure it had a lot of clichés and stereotypical characters but avatar works very well anyway the story despite being predictable it still have a lot of fun to offer also the visual are simply wonderful creating a completely new world never seen before in movies this was definitely the best part of it and it makes interesting even the most boring and trivial parts of the story im not sure if avatar is a revolutionary film the only thing that i could say that for being such an ambitious film it doesnt disappoint sure it isnt the best film ever made but it was very funny to watch,positive
76,doc_77,i confess that this film never really caught my eye until i read about it i still remember when it was in theaters more than ten years ago more recently i decided to see it the film was a success as we all know and i find it surprising that i didnt have the right to any sequelsthe script takes place in a distant future when humans have ruined the earth but are colonizing and exploring other planets like pandora where jake sully a veteran of the marines is going after being recruited by a scientific program pandora has a rare and valuable ore that humans want but it also allows the planet to have an exuberant and unusual biological life it happens to be inhabited by natives called naavi who look like huge blue humans with a long tail and they are determined to protect their world from the greed of the terrans sully joins the avatar program which allows him to remotely control the body of a naavi if the program allows humans to live and learn from them as its director scientist dr grace wants it also turns them into trojan horses as colonel miles commander of the military forces in pandora wishes this will put sully in a conflict of loyalties while allowing him to see how the natives are connected to their world and are inseparable from itthe plot raises a number of pertinent questions we can for example reflect on the way we have lived and managed our planet on the superiority with which we see who is different from us on how we despise the environment or deliberately harm it by greed on our passion for war instead of peaceful conflict resolution or even about how technological and medical advances do not reach everyone and are put at the service of some wealthy people instead of being available to all it is a script that makes you think and could be seen in many ways unfortunately the story built on these premises is not so good there is good material and the way sully is divided in his loyalty as he lives with the natives is the backbone of the whole thing but everything else is quite predictable and onedimensional and sometimes it sounds bad humans are treated in a simplistic way and turned into despicable creatures while the naavi are idealized to the fullest the old story of good guys and bad guyssam worthington shows all his talent in a demanding and likeable character he plays well with zoe saldaña his alien romantic couple the actress is excellent and was having a good time in her career then i also liked the work of sigourney weaver in the role of a strong bossy and grumpy scientist who is guided by her ideals even if it means facing the military but the best of the cast ends here the rest are reduced to onedimensional and stupid characters as is the case with stephen lang the brute like the stones colonel who only thinks about his mission michelle rodríguez the military hot girl who decides to collaborate with the goodies instead of helping the baddies giovanni ribisi one of the baddies joel david moore one of the goodies laz alonso cch pounder wes studi the perfect ones etc this was somewhat disappointing in a film with so many qualities and such a high budgetit is in the technical aspects that this film excels directed by james cameron an avid fan of the green screen and a rival of spielberg its a film that was built on top of an entire digital world thanks to this feature cameron can become a god for a minute and create a new universe with plants and animals that we have never seen and that exude beauty the film has a spectacular cinematography and it does not pass five minutes without in some way making us hold our breath before such a show of color and light sound effects are very wellused also together with an epic and magnificent soundtrack by james horner we have the recipe for a blockbuster film that collected three oscars in technical categories best cinematography best visual effects and best art direction with all the fairness and merit i really feel sorry that i didnt see it on the big screen and that cameron is so careless when it comes to the script and the story he tells us,positive
77,doc_78,this movie is less about plot and more about universe creation calling this movie stylish is an understatement it is a visual masterpiece that goes a long way to cover up the simple storybut what a universe hop a board and marvel in an amazingly atmospheric extravaganzaits movies like this that help keep the cinema experience alive,positive
78,doc_79,to be honest avatar is the most perfect superficial movie what do i mean it looks exciting feels exciting but i couldnt generate a feeling for iti think avatar is a must see movie mainly because its a part of the history of cinema the reason the extreme hype it generated even after coming out in theatersim sure i was one of the last people to watch it on theaters january 30th and believe me i had high expectations towards it because everybody talked about itthe truth is that avatar isnt by any means the best movie of all time or even a film that should change your life or cinema overallsure its a movie that will out stand you with its spectacular amazing fx i cant think of any other movie with such powerful images and atmosphere i mean the world created for the movie is taken from dreams or something similar also the navi lifestyle is beyond fantasy and i give credit for the writers the main problem in my opinion is the lack of a strong plot sure theres a message towards our planet and how we take care of its natural resources and all the political correctness but in terms of creativity i dont think the film gives us enoughsure i cared for the main characters and their situations but the plot didnt thrill me by any means theres plenty of action emotional speeches dialogs etc but the movie focuses way too much on the exterior and leaves behind the plotsam worthington is the new action hero and i second it hes good looking he acts very well and truly delivers passion in his scenes zoe saldana is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance although we only see her avatar sigourney weaver is amazing as always stephen lang delivers enough badass lines scenes and more to be considered one of the most hated characters in recent film history too bad i didnt care for him in the end giovanni ribisi does his thing just ok and michelle rodriguez is just way too hot her cleavage stole my attention several timesthe score is great fantastic a new epic in all the sense of the word avatar is truly one of the most spectacular movies ever made thats it,positive
79,doc_80,avatar is still pure eye candy to watch the weakest point maybe is the rather simple and generic story line if you take all the sci fi glamour away you get pocahontas anyway the effects and visuals are topnotch and the tempo of the story unfolding never leaves you bored still a fine looking and entertaining scifi action movie,positive
80,doc_81,avatar is a great looking movie theres no denying that the story and the characters arent that original but that doesnt bother me what bothers me about avatar is the length its too long by at least a half an hour i saw this movie in the theater in 3d lynbrook ny and several times since my reaction is always the same im all in for in first couple of hours or so but then my interest starts to fade avatar is a near miss for me,neutral
81,doc_82,james cameron is a storied director whose films have been landmarks of their time like he did in the 80s and 90s with both terminator films he returns from his 10year hiatus without missing a beat shepherding audiences into the future of cinema with progressive filmmaking done with the most advanced technology avatar is a miraculous visual feat the greatest epic since the lord of the rings and a filmmaking milestone unlike any other at the conclusion of a decade its a window into what audiences of the future can expect at the moviesthere really is no film avatar can be compared to other than star wars because of the sciencefiction originality the world of pandora and navi all come from camerons head as did the star wars universe from that of george lucas although star wars is a much wider and complex universe avatars world is still incredibly imaginative and awesome spectacle is avatars greatest asset and cameron utilizes it completely bringing our attention to all the tightest details the multitude of creatures inhabiting pandora and the remarkably life like navi captivate almost entirely on looks alonethe story of avatar uses classic archetypes that while not entirely original best serve the purposes of the film jake sully upandcoming aussie sam worthington is a paraplegic exmarine given a second chance by filling in for his brother on an operation on the planet pandora he becomes part of the avatar program which allows humans to enter artificially created navi the humanoid blue catlike natives versions of themselves sullys mission is to get to better know the navi and their culture from the inside but col quatrich stephen lang convinces him to divulge intel should the navi not be willing to abandon their home so the humans can force their way to a rare and valuable resource called unobtainium located therenaturally jake gets very close to the navi tribe who teaches him the navi way of life he becomes attached to their princess neytiri zoe saldana who takes him through rites of passage explaining how the navi are connected with the planet and all living things on it in the figurative and literal sense were introduced to a world unlike anything weve seen before predictably the navi and humans are destined for a fatal showdown and jakes change of heart will make him the controversial key to its endcamerons script is very socially driven using terms like fighting terror with terror and shock and awe its blatantly critical of america and completely unforgiving of the human race youll come out of avatar thinking how awful we are and how cameron assigns us no redeeming qualities other than the few characters that decide the oppression of the navi is wrong it does however effectively sway our emotions the most riveting concept in the film is that although jake becomes one of them his actual self is in a machine and any tampering with it brings him back to his handicapped human self in this way avatar is one ofakind in terms of storyin classic cameron fashion avatar is incredibly long but with the motioncapture cgi and 3d and you must see it 3d to experience the scope its completely justified parts do drag and feel unrealistic or excessive at times but the sheer magnitude of the movie and its visual prowess are plenty of an excuse to go a tad overthetopsome other impressive foodforthought about this movie is how humans are not only the enemy but theyre not integral to the film never before has a liveaction movie not needed to rely on human characters the motioncapture and the subtle human qualities of navi are good enough to carry the film other producers mightve sought to counter that with big name actors but cameron like in his other films refuses this insanely expensive project not only benefited from saving that cash but is testament to camerons storytelling abilityavatar is simply an experience a groundbreaking and truly miraculous endeavor from the mind of cinemas most forwardthinking filmmaker its one of those rare achievements where flaws are so easily forgiven because of sheer innovation and imagination see this film and experience a new dawn in movie historysteven cvisit my site at moviemusereviewscom,positive
82,doc_83,defenders say its an incredible piece of artistic technical wizardry maybe but that only takes it so far before the farfromcompelling story rears its giant blue head detractors say its a blatant copy of movies like dances with wolves pocahontas maybe but its also better than both of those in reality avatar is just an overhyped and overcriticized cornball epic equal parts exciting frankly boring still the universe is cool enough to make the sequels appealing,neutral
83,doc_84,james cameron is an interesting director increasingly mia but seemingly invulnerable to the risk of the huge productions he tackles on the rare occasions when he does return to work back in the days of true lies and titanic everybody expected his next most expensive movie ever to be the heavens gate of fx film but by now most of us have given up that expectation as it seems he has an incredible knack for picking the kind of stories that work well with fx and tie together action and sentiment really the only time hes failed was with the abyss a movie that you had to admire but which was hard to enjoy i kind of expected avatar to be a more elaborate version of abyss but its quite a lot more cohesive if simple and compelling than any of his action films in quite a number of yearsso let that be the first caveat and the first qualifier this is an action movie those who expected it to be high drama andor to challenge the formulas of film storytelling will have to look elsewhere hint terry gilliam has a new one out on dvd this month too while the film does have an interesting scifi premise basically its a reverse of his original terminator film in which machines were designed to look like humans to infiltrate their refugee camps while in this one humans are the baddies and they use avatars in native form to infiltrate alien camps it doesnt really go anywhere with it basically the story is more of a melodrama than anything else about an invading human being persuaded to the side of the native navi viewpoint and helping to beat the attacking hordes of humansit doesnt really matter because i found myself watching this in 3d in the theater basically not wanting to miss a second of it its just all so fascinating to look at even if youre never entirely inside the world of the movie or at least i wasnt constantly were just so awestruck by the fantasy world that we start to think about the effects which kind of takes you out of the movie but then you dont want to stop watching to see what will happen next in the effects not the story so its very engrossing cinema regardless of where the interest is coming from,positive
84,doc_85,when all is said and done when you look at avatar as a movie apart from its social phenomenon you are supposed to find this a parable for western politics cameron clearly does indeed implicating computer technology for its central role in manmade destruction avatar nevertheless utilizes the very same to create some of its innovative and hugely influential visuals the bulk of camerons work displays an apparent distrust of technological advancement which is peculiarly at variance with his elaborate deployment of stateoftheart cinematic technology his postvietnam and postfeminist action epicsaliens the terminator movies true liesdraw upon both technological and nuclear anxiety in the midst of reagans resurgent cold war politicsavatar itself is fundamentally hailed for being a technological advancement it is an exceedingly outlandishly gigantic visual experience unlike anything weve seen before it has an explicit green and antiwar message the writings on the wall dictate that it launch a worshipping faddism it contains such visual embellishment that it surely sweetens repeated viewings it even authors a new language to which i doubt human beings can do justice it is the quintessential event movie one of those films you feel you need to see to keep up with social discourse setting napoleonic bond villainesque humans against virtuous extraterrestrial rebels is a hopeful uturn of the aliens stencil but perhaps requires paul verhoevens keen comicbook intensity to drive the reversal into real subversionthe human analogy on the lush earthlike moon of pandora is a tenfoottall blueskinned species of sentient humanoids called the navi an earth corporation is mining a valuable mineral known with mystifying ambiguity as unobtanium but for us humans to brave outside of our landing domain we use avatars navi doppelgangers grown naturally and mindcontrolled by humans who lay down wired up unconscious on the ship which is where the 3d element becomes more than just an ogling tool and takes on a metaphysical effect while functioning as avatars we sense and feel like navi and have all the same physical skill the most interesting element of this is how the hero is a paraplegic rather than being a selfevident badass hes been recruited since hes a genetic match for his dead twin brother for whom an expensive avatar was constructed in avatar state he is exhilarated by his magnified ability to walk again not to mention being ten feet tall and his compensation for this assignment he will be given a very expensive operation to recover movement in his legs theoretically hes good to go for if his avatar is harmed his human body is elsewherethe navi survive in their world by having a deep relationship with it living as one with nature and being thoughtful about the creatures they share with in this and various other ways they symbolize native americans like them they discipline another species to have them at their disposal like giant flying dragonlike creatures on that admirable note i found the significance tapering into impatience nearing its obligatory colossal climactic showdown between humans and aliens after all a character has done that has betrayed the noble navi returning to them with a demonstration that he has tamed a supposedly untamable dragonlike supercreature all is forgiven its just too sexy for them to stay mad anymoreindeed the bigger it all is the cockier every bit of james camerons muscle seems to go into making our eyes bulge and genuflect in worship of the 3d dazzle on the screen on one hand its an outstandingly accessible exhibition of defying capitalism and championing the uphill battle for the defense of nature but done with mostly stale dialogue and boilerplate characterization essentially its a million 162minute montage of cardboard allegories and plot devices made by putting a bunch of screenplays in a blender but we still say wow and why not if you can get a theater full of people here in the american midwest to flock to and cheer for america getting conquered by an indigenous tribe in war then youve got one amazing work of spectacle its the experience more than the allegory thats worth a nod,positive
85,doc_86,i saw avatar in the theater when it was released i thought it was a lot of fun and exciting to watch however i found the story to be subpar and more of a copy of the destruction of indigenous tribes from all over the world not that is a bad thing but it was boring because it made the story predictable an unoriginalthe graphics are great and i thought seeing it on the big screen was well worth the time and cost the movie deserves to be played on the best televisions if you are watching at home watching it on a small pad or phone really doesnt do it justicei do have problems with some of the graphics and a perfect example is fire and how it burns the atmosphere is heavier than earth and flames shouldnt react the way they are depicted with the higher carbon dioxide there is less than oxygen in the air im not sure the director really thought this one outthe armoredmech units also move because they need to and this is deus ex machina and a writing fallacy it is cheap and poorly executed idea sure one could say that they have better technology to make them react this way but if you think of the physics of large machines like this in the animal kingdom too larger creatures move slower but are more powerful i found it unappealing to see this in the moviethe direction is all wrong because the movie uses deus ex machina through out the entire movie things happen because the writersdirector force them to happen the movie doesnt flow naturally and it is oddly pieced together with scenes which are filleroverall its a good movie but ranking it thats difficult a for the graphics but a d and c grade on writing and direction with a lower mark for the lack of logic,negative
86,doc_87,there have been perhaps two or three films in my lifetime that have been so good that i went back into the movie theater to see them a second time this ones one of themdirector james cameron has been one of hollywoods most successful and most prolific film makers for a long time my personal theory is that hes just so good at giving the audience exactly what they want to see in order to be pleased shocked rejuvenated excited and entertained after the box office miracle story that was titanic he moved away from the central stage and only returned back to fulllength feature film with this one avatar the highestgrossing film of all time managing to surpass even titanic and thus cameron has directed the two highestgrossing films of all time thats pure talentso what makes avatar so interesting and so engrossing well on the technical side of things at the time of its release avatar was the best looking film we had ever seen four years have since passed and it has withstood the test of time remarkably well and i think that it will continue to do so its an utterly breathtaking film the foreign world of pandora opens in front of your eyes in thousands of shades of colour each individual plant creature and mountain a miracle to look at in its own right gorgeous beautiful majestic aweinspiring are all words that this films easily earnsthis artistry alone would warrant me to recommend this film but i also happen to like the story and the characters a great deal avatar has been accused of rehashing old white man amongst natives story lines it has been accused of being just a ripoff of dances with wolves pocahontas ferngully and countless other similar films i dont get these people the stories have similarities yes and avatar is a bit predictable but do these people really claim that if a particular story has already been told you are not allowed to try and make a better version of that story your version because thats what avatar is its this generations amongst natives story told with gorgeous imagery great characters and exciting storytelling so what if you can predict how the storys going to end the same holds true for all the romantic comedies most of the action films and all the sport films yet people dont complain when those have a storyline thats similar to previous films well okay some do but not as vehemently as they did in the case of avatar backlash against its success maybe avatars story is just fine its the visuals the world the music and the characters that make an adventure film like this work and all four of those are great ive already stated my opinion about pandora and how it looks on screen james horners score fits the mood and style of the film perfectly being grandiose little bit foreign and dramatic likewise with the actors that all do a really good job sam worthington and zoe saldana have great chemistry together as jake sully the crippled marine and neytiri the princess of the navi special mention should also go to stephen lang and his character colone miles quaritch one of the most badass soldiers in recent cinema historylongish review but thats because its a movie that divides opinions some people seem to hate it because of its seeming unoriginality others focus on the good sides and absolutely love it i belong to the latter camp and thus avatar belongs amongst my favourite movies of all time see it if you havent already,positive
87,doc_88,my avatar is an odd film isnt it the week i rewatched it it overtook endgame as the highest grossing film of all time again but i do find that stat baffling i mean as a film its fine but there are dozens of equally themed action adventures that didnt manage anything like the level of successset in the future the human race has landed on pandora and has begun strip mining the planet for a natural resource aside from a strong military presence the mining firm are attempting diplomatic measures interacting with the native population using genetically engineered bodies designed to replicate the navis large size blue skin and ability to breathe the atmosphere these avatar bodies are piloted by humans one such is jake sully sam worthington a former marine who slowly becomes intoxicated by the connected and transcendent ways of the nativesi mean its a pretty thin parable for the native american experience or any country that knew the joys of british colonialism we want what those people have lets call them savages and move them off their land with an overwhelming force and then in our case teach them religion and cricket its a wellworn oft repeated story which again makes it a little more baffling why this particular version of the narrative earned as much money as it didthere is one way though that it is superior to a lot of the others it looks incredible still years later its the very cutting edge of cgi work the planets the interaction the various forms of flora and fauna and the navi themselves all look amazing occasionally the interaction between the soldiers and their mechwarrior style rigs is a little off but only occasionally and in the climactic scenes theyre spot on againits a decent good even but i cant fathom why people went to see it so many times nor who wants the four upcoming sequels,neutral
88,doc_89,avatar is phenomenal nowhere else is the pagan story told so clearly lovingly and well this is a film for all time all peoples it resonates with the indigenous peoples throughout the world with the lives of their ancestors and the oral histories passed down by hundreds of culturesaside from that we found avatar to be entertaining well made creatively produced and lovingly presented there are many factors in this film one can love and designate as a favorite part well established characters and a tight storyline with good pacing there doesnt seem to be a second of wasted film in this lengthy epic taleall in all this is great viewing anytime and sufficiently awesome for fridaysaturday night viewing we bought the blu ray and cannot wait to own the extended edition later next year or soit rates a fromthe fiend,positive

90,doc_91,avatar is a fancy word an appropriate one i guess for a movie that is both awesome and silly as the movie explains its a hindu term for the incarnation of a god on earth but actually just as in the recent movie surrogates which cameron was involved in and the matrix somebody is lying in a room all wired up while he or she is running a virtual second self doing stuff out somewhere thats what an avatar is in surrogates the virtual selves are mainly just misbehaving in avatar were on the planet pandora where a private corporation rda whose boss a pale nasty named for a british

making friends with the omaticaya winning the hearts and minds you know they work with the omaticaya in the form of avatars that are tall blue skinny people like them this allows them to pass so to speak and make up for the fact that the air on pandora is too thin to breathe meanwhile quaritch and his boys are talking shock and awe and fighting terror with terror yeah the references are as simple and schematic as thattheres a whole lot going on in cameronss avatar and at the same time not very much it takes a while to explain the setup but after that its pretty simple what happensgrace is very disappointed when jake sully arrives on pandora hes a marine corporal sent to replace his dead twin brother because hes got the right dna to operate his brothers avatar but while his brother was a scientist hes just a jarhead whos been rendered paraplegic in a recent war jakes background makes him appeal a lot to col quaritch but grace starts to like him when he takes so well to working his avatar that he connects right away with omaticaya princess neytiri zoe saldana and is quickly adopted by her tribe its sort of an emerald forestcumdancing with wolves situation jake goes native and he picks up a good speaking knowledge of navi though the locals due to sigourneys teaching tend to speak excellent english which might disappoint professor frommer of usc whom cameron engaged to invent a complete navi language there are speeches in navi with rather ornate subtitles as if it were a medieval language but the whole cultural thing is focused more on what we might call the neurospiritual element cameron has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and engaged thousands in making this movie and the fun of it is for a while anyway in the elaborate way the details of pandora have been worked out quaritch describes it as worse than hell and the sixlegged dinohorses hammerhead rhinos shellcovered snarling tigers fourarmed lemurs and so on as well as the little floating jellyfish creatures are pretty challenging for avatarjake his first night incountry but since he bonds with neytiri right away her name even sounds a bit like tommytommees amazon forest girlfriend kachiri in emerald forest and learns to turn terrifying flying beasts into his docile steeds by connecting the end of his pigtail to their neural tendrils jakes avatar life becomes way more exciting than anything hes ever done before and in a running video journal he keeps he admits hes begun to forget what the rest of his life was even like before thisnew york times film critic ao scott exclaimed recently that avatar is unusual as a blockbuster in that it doesnt come from a comic book it doesnt come from a novel it doesnt come from a line of toys it comes from james camerons imagination well the material here is very much like lots of scifi novels the kind i used to read as a teenager comic books lines of toys and video games so theres nothing so extraordinary about camerons imagination whats extraordinary is the miseenscene and the way motioncapture is used to give the avatars expressions and movements and then theyre digitalized to incorporate them in these rather sexy tall skinny figures with their rather corny amerindian outfits and hairdos and the elaborate flora and fauna of pandoraunfortunately it all ends in a noisy protracted shootout that makes it like the dreadful but intermittently atmospheric terminator salvation which lo and behold costarred sam worthington watching this as the noise and explosions became steadily drearier and more familiar i realized that camerons titanic which i loved much more than this mainly because it had real people and events in it however romantically magnified also went on far too long there are things about avatar that are very fun but the navi even at their sexiest still look like plasticy video game dolls and those who declare this to be a cinematic spectacle thats wonderful beyond anything since and dw griffith david denby in the same interview are really falling prey to the hype,positive
91,doc_92,classifying avatar as science fiction is a misnomer if you take away the whole idea of the avatar technology you end up with a standard hollywood action movie and the technology is truly dispensable for the year id rather have a genetically modified humanoid standing on his own two feet rather than an avatar both ideas are farfetched but the idea of an avatar who is controlled through some kind of vague telepathic commands emanating from a human being deep asleep while in a coma seems much more the stuff of comic books than semiplausible science fictionwithout the avatar gimmick camerons story is nothing more than an allegory of the mistreatment of native americans by the white man cameron harks back to the 17th century where the idea of the noble savage was in vogue socalled primitive people were held up as natural and spiritual untarnished by the corrupting effects of western civilization also at play were deepseated guilt feelings over the perceived deleterious effects of european colonialismin camerons tale the colonialists have been updated to military contractors who have somehow bought the heart and soul of the american military itself were told that the adventurers on pandora are exmarines all there for the money the contractors are headed by two stock villains parker selfridge the civilian corporate chief and colonel quaritch an amalgam of the worst rightwing military types you could ever think of cameron makes no effort in humanizing his two antagonists on the other hand the indigenous people the navi can do no wrong not only have they mastered their skills in surviving in the wild but have tapped into the mystical forces of the forest which put our own holistic healers to shamewhile the navi are certainly standins for native americans they are not native americans of the american west in the 19th century but rather more akin to earlier forest dwelling indians as depicted in james fenimore coopers last of the mochicans is it a coincidence that one of the stars of the early 90s film version of that book is wes studi who plays eytukan here cameron must bring in other cinematic influences to make sure that this is not simply a rehash of an early 18th century romantic novel in the beginning with images of space travelers coming out of suspended animation inside a spaceship one is reminded of such iconic films as a space odyssey and the scifi horror tale alien and what about all those futuristic helicopters that are constantly firing missiles at the hapless natives i can only think of mediocre vietnamera war movies such as the green berets starring john wayne avatar is also derivative of spielberg films such as jurassic park with its emphasis on prehistoric creatures who seem to have a continuous anger management problemas for avatars plot its all rather predictable stuff the enlightened scientists are pitted against the hardboiled military none of whom seem to have a conscience the films hero jake sully already is told that the bad guys are planning to wipe the navi out but it takes him three months to warm up to them i had a hard time believing that sully would side so easily with the evil colonel from the beginningyes he was offered the carrot of getting his legs back but as a paraplegic wouldnt that have made him wary of the colonels unrelenting disdain for the underdog in other words wasnt it obvious that the colonel was a real bad guy from the very beginning whats more wouldnt sully have tried to warn the navi earlier instead of waiting to the last hour he could have perhaps persuaded one or two navi to form a reconnaissance team and to check out the base in order to convince them that the enemy had the capability to wipe them out also at the end why did the navi let the defeated enemy leave the planet wouldnt they have slaughtered all of them oh i forgottheyre noble savagesdespite the derivative and mediocre story avatar keeps your interest due to its excellent special effects cameron is a master at computer animation and keeps you riveted on all the action despite insulting your intellect avatar is a sensory delight but seeing it more than once is not recommended,neutral
92,doc_93,in the magical world of director james cameron there lives a great genius his repertoire of movies lists some of hollywoods most awesome cinematic adventures and this one will no doubt crown all those fine achievements in his ledger are some astounding and certainly memorable films such as apollo abyss titanic and of course the futuristic terminator all have made his name a household word here is yet another triumph for him and in this reviewers opinion his very best the movie is called avatar and even the name is mythic in nature its the story of a young wounded paraplegic marine named jake sully sam worthington who volunteers to replace his twin brother and become an avatar on a supposedly scientific expedition under the direction of dr grace augustine sigourney weaver her tasks is to study the rich ecosystem of the planet searching for a rare material called unobtainum this unique material is the primary reason why joel moore norm spellman and his powerful business conglomerate have enlisted the military the armed force is under the direction of colonel miles quaritch stephen lang a no nonsense hard core officer who promises to destroy the indigenous population of the planet if need be to secure the mining rights unaware of their destructive intentions jakes clandestine mission on the planet pandora is to integrated into the tribes and learn how the military can decimate them however jake soon discovers if he succeeds he will become a willing participant in the outright slaughter and brutal murder of a spiritual and peaceful race the entire movie is a trill ride of a lifetime the planet pandora contains a gigantic plethora of natural splendor incredible vistas wondrous mystical creatures and a cornucopia of lasting beauty which could only arise in the mind of james cameron with a superb supporting cast containing zoe saldana the new uhura of star trek laz alonso and wes studi i am not surprised it top the charts and won the highest honors as well as a world wide audience all of which will assure this film becomes a classic for future generations a remarkable milestone for all enthustically recommended for all audiences,positive

94,doc_95,after years with his success with titanic the great action director james cameron is back with the longwaited avatar avatar is the most expensive film ever made a possible revolution in cinema technology and 3d and a massive gamble for fox studios who under tom rothman have become the laughing stock of hollywood rothman himself is still derided and hated though there was a lot of hype surrounding the film and some feared that it would underwhelm audience but luckily it didnton the moon planet pandora the rda corporation is trying to mine the planet for unobtainium the most valuable resource known to man the navi tribes people a tall blue skinned nature loving cat like people live on the abundant source of it the company is willing to use military force led by colonel miles quaritch stephen lang a tough military man dr grace augustine sigourney weaver a scientist wants to study the people and wildlife and wants to use diplomacy to convince the navi to move to a different site she wants to win hearts and minds by educating the navi here jake scully sam worthington a disabled former marine steps in his twin brother had died but he is a biological match to his avatar a genetically created navi which human being could transfer their minds in on a scientific mission jake gets separated from the team and ends up meeting a native navi neytiri zoë saldaña he joins the tribe starts to learn their ways their love and link to nature and starts to fall for neytiri but jake is stuck in a three way conflict between the military who he promises to give them intelligence the scientists who want to study the planet and befriend the navi and the navi themselves which he gains their trust and where his loyalties belongsthe story is nothing too original their are elements of films like lawrence of arabia and the last samurai where an outside becomes a member of close knit tribe the matrix with the idea of transferring your mind into another body and allows you to do extraordinary things and the alien series where a company is responsible for aggressive action the story and theme of colonisation in the film was properly influenced by americas actions in the wild west against native americans but to me it reminded me of the east india company and colonisation in africa where forming colonies was influenced by private business not government action james cameron is an excellent writer and crafts a lot of different ideas and plot in an brilliant film there are a lot of factions and themes which are well told and cameron follows his old ideas of character development his classics like the terminator and aliens were great because of the characters not just the action all the characters are interesting my personal favourite was neytiri but all were given a chance to shine as well as the theme of colonisation the vietnam and iraq wars much have influenced cameron iraq because of a military invasion of a foreign people for a valuable resource and because of vietnam and iraq because a technological superior force is outnumbered and in a foreign climate the last theme is the idea of technology against nature and the balance of live the navi are linked to nature and its a part of their culture and religion whilst the humans just destroy nature without a care a commentary about global warning in todays world cameron is follow the gaia hypothesis where the world is a living being with everything being interlinkedwhat james cameron is truly great at is action and of course action is some of the best ever put to screen as an action film by itself avatar is the best of though district and inglorious basterds were very good you actually get to see the action the camera follows it not shaking about or too close so you cant see anything it is well edited and just a join to watch compared to some modern action films cameron transfers you to another world he creates a beautiful world with wonderful designs and with great creature designs as well it reminds me of king kong both the and versions cameron did put a lot of thought into the history and culture of the navi as well the cgi is fantastic and the 3d is brilliant it was so well done that it added depth to the film giving it a more hands on feel however i think 3d life avatar are going to be few and far between with 3d mostly being the reserve of animated films and bmovie horrorthere is a good cast that goes without saying zoë saldaña stephen lang and sigourney weaver are of particular note of praise sigourney weaver almost reminded of her role as dian fossey in gorillas in the mist sam worthington is clearly a star in the making having stole the show in terminator salvation and now having the lead role in avatar i am looking forward to clash of the titans next year its also good to see michelle rodriguez career back on trackthere are some criticism of the film first its a bit too long with a running time over two and half hours and there are elements that could have been cut or shorten some of the dialogue was weak and at times stated the obvious i think cameron was trying to come up with some more classic onelines and finally as stated some ideas and story elements were copied from other filmsworth watching and one of the most fun films i seen in the cinema for a whilst,positive
95,doc_96,in the wachowski brothers made a science fiction action movie which changed the face of action for a good five years as suddenly now every movie had to have this new thing called bullettime which is ironic since bullettime is essentially protocinematic and the first movement tests of muybridge circa were the exact same thing as bullettime the theme of the matrix was essentially technophobic despite its gamechanging technological spectacle because it said outright dont take that blue pill get out of dream land and live in the real world the sucky barren survivalist real world that is so much more worth saving than your tasty steakfilled dreamland exactly ten years later cameron comes out with a movie about saving the environment and the killing off of our connection with the earth but the entire narrative is developed through the titular thematic component avatars and no not just the navi avatars everybody in this movie has an avatar the big bad meany boss commando is never more comfortable unless hes in his cameronfavorite mechwarrior the navi download themselves right into the creatures of the forest the oreminer general uses his corporation as his avatar the problem is that through all of this downloading virtual recreation and multiple personalities is that the theme of reconnecting to the world gets lost in the pure desire to log into a different outward appearance of ones self which is never deconstructed but in fact reinforced by the navis own spiritual uploading of personalities between bodies the weird thing is that the whole idea that the world of pandora is a giant synaptic brain really never seems to be of consequence until the battle at the end except that were just supposed to believe in it based on what characters say not what is shown whereas the matrix makes its downloading program quite clear from the uh intro screen you know that famous intro screen pandora never really makes its presence known except for an action sequence im just sayinthe only two quotes that mattered i see you now and now real life felt more like the dream these are the rough equivalents to the matrixs why do my eyes hurt and stop trying to hit me and hit me therefore as much as im not really as critical of other people about avatars storytelling and themes its all archetypical and not worth getting upset over or endless comparisons to similar story lines i just feel its necessary to point out that wherein the medium is the message the message of avatar is log in its a technophiliac celebration of virtual reality and functionally so i do not in fact consider that to be a negative thing or really criticize that approach i just feel with the amount of attention this movie is getting i have not really heard that acknowledged so going to those people who are sad cause pandora aint realit is in fact functionally dialectic to the experience of the film wherein fan culture develops through cultural events such as this film i see avatar as predominantly an invitation and its one that the world has seemed to accept so now that the game has changed and 3d is the blockbuster motif it is time to start reappraising fantasy worlds and figure out how to immerse the audience into truly alternative realities than simply escapist worldspolarisdib,neutral
96,doc_97,set in the year this visually spectacular yet emotionally haywire tale of a ruthless rape attempt by humans of the planet pandora for its valuable resources and the nearannihilation of the navi peoples an indigenous humanoid species of said planet borrowed heavily i think from the wellknown story of tarzanof course avatars story was set on a much greater scale than that of a mere tarzanlike jungle tale but all the same thats how it appeared to meavatars story also brought to mind the reality of christopher columbuss discovering of america in and his search for valuable resources and the devastating effect that that fateful incident had on all of the native peoples of both the american continentswith a film of this ones striking visual magnitude its so easy for the viewer to be completely swept away by the sheer beauty and wonder of it all and to just allow the story to take a back seat for itselfand that is exactly what happened here with avatar it unfortunately relied far too heavily on the splendour of its visuals to carry it through and that left us with a story that already had the wind clearly knocked out of its sails by the halfway pointnote directed by james cameron avatars budget was million,neutral
97,doc_98,its obvious within watching this 3d movie for the first minutes that this movie is breakthrough in cinematic expression in the class like the star wars was in the 70s the tone of the story for the first of the movie makes you feel like you might be watching another dark tale of ostracized society like the one depicted in matrix i was thinking oh here we go again darkness sold as realism or a story driven plot then way into the story it was like is it another cowboy and indian movie where the cowboys with modern weapons levels the indians whore basically fighting with bows and arrows then the complete surprise came in the last quarter of the movie where the cowboys are actually shown as the bad guys theres no mistake that the sky people depicted in this movie are americans and their corporate greed and military industrial complex has formed a fascist state of arrogance and insensitivity to any rights of others in the name of profit and control i wont go into the spoilers of how the movie ends but its surprising that an american director okay hes canadian but would take such objective view of his own countrythis is a movie that comes once in a life time and is easily one of the top movies of the last decade i believe 3d experience will become the norm in future movies until 3d becomes a dirty word like so many over commercialized technology has become thumbs up for james cameron,positive
98,doc_99,james camerons longawaited titanic followup is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development the characters are one dimensional both as written and as portrayed and theres hardly anything unpredictable the only thing this movie has going for it are its stateoftheart effects which are truly bogglingsam worthington plays jake a paraplegic exmarine whos sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium in the running for the least creative chemical name ever seems theres a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle thats populated by an indigenous race called the navi blueskinned really tall people with feline characteristics meanwhile a scientific program headed by grace augustine played by a typically stiff sigourney weaver has focused on learning as much as possible about the navi in order to benefit scientific knowledge augustines research funded by the same company whos mining the unobtainium involves the use of avatars in which scientists form a psychological link with a mockup that looks just like a native navi the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere jake gets inside the navi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium during the course of his mission he falls for the navi chiefs daughter neytiri zoe saldana of course he does and as said mission drags on jakes perspective changes from meathead jerk to treeloving jerk and he begins to wonder if what hes doing is rightis he serious youre an alien race humans and have no business on this moon your employers stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find basically raping the planet your employer will stop at nothing to get it as he answers to no one youre being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit and he thinks this might be wrong a power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition a colonel quaritch stephen lang decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the navi with the approval of the head of the company parker selfridge giovanni ribisi another patently obvious name this sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive navi and the gungho exmarine humans who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows even a star destroyer or two the final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the battle of endor in return of the jedi in which the primitive ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some oldschool homemade traps of destructionbut even if the plot doesnt need to be complex it sure ought to make sense heres a nonspoiler question to ponder jake under the guise of his avatar is taken in by the navi whose spiritual leader asks neytiri to teach jake their ways why this is to be is not terribly clear its evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the navi but that prior emissaries had been scientists as soon as jake tells the navi that hes a warrior theyre all about teaching him i dont quite follow the logic here if i were the navi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously to me were not there to do me harm why in the world would i want to teach someone whos used to using aggression and violence to solve problems i get that the navi as a warrior race would relate more to the soldier but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway let alone with one who might well do them harmmoreover im not sure what the navi thought jake was really he looked like them through his avatar but they referred to him at least once as an alien my best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan other clan ill assume that only this one clan the omaticaya made its home at hometree yet another clumsy naming convention and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it but if they simply thought jake was from another clan why did they let him in anyway why did they teach him what purpose would it serve them and on top of that since the omaticaya mentioned being approached by aliens before doesnt it seem more likely that they would have assumed jake was another alien ambassador anyway this makes my brain hurti think its pretty obvious that cameron wanted this to be his own star wars an epic taking place on a distant world he uses the standard cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade thats simplifying things a bit the effects it should be noted are really mesmerizing visuals of the jawdropping variety the 3d effects were unbelievable and i mean that in a good way avatar is extraordinarily shot using cgi and live action and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined its a remarkable filmbut its only part of a film the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience and when a film is emotionally uninvolving its lost the battle for your heartand thats the core problem despite some wonderful beautiful effects avatar gives us characters in whom we cant really get invested and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance this is a crucial fatal flaw,neutral
99,doc_100,how does james cameron do it how does he manage to take a hokey transparent story and make it work it is amazing just like with titanic mr cameron creates a great movie out of an old story the movie is great because it grabs and keeps the audiences interest also mr cameron takes cgi to a new level of sophistication so much so that soon the cgi and the real acting merge as one and it works having expected this movie to be little more than a long cartoon surprisingly the movie is a work of cinematic art and not just an animated feature with voice overs added the cast is superb especially stephen lang who plays perhaps the most challenging role and the always lovely michelle rodriguez who gives a strong performance as a soldier with a heart if this movie proves anything it is that michelle rodriguez is one of the finest actors in hollywood today and beautiful too,positive
100,doc_101,defying all analytical expectations james camerons followup to titanic not only proved commercially successful but actually outgrossed its colossal predecessor yet the mantle of historys highestgrossing film is not easily borne by the end of january with billion worth of ticket sales behind it one finds it impossible not to form unrealistic expectations before a firsttime viewing avatar succeeds admirably in many regards but also disappoints in a few in a purely technical sense the film is a masterpiece camerons use of the 3d technology particularly viewed on the mammoth imax screens isnt gimmicky enough to draw attention to itself but instead strives to immerse the viewer in the incredible computer generated landscapes of pandora where ferns brush against your face and insects buzz lazily through your field of vision this is the closest weve got so far to a visceral immersive cinema experiencewhere i did take issue with avatar was its screenplay we know that cameron is a capable screenwriter both of the terminator films and true lies were impeccablyscripted action films but here he traipses a wellworn path the story strongly indebted to the story of pocahantas and every other cinematic derivative never and i really mean never takes an unexpected course this painful predictability did inevitably detract from my enjoyment because one would expect a majestic otherworld like pandora to be fruitful with unexpected delights and yet cameron delivers few also quality sciencefiction films are rare nowadays and i didnt particularly like how avatar had morphed into fullblown mystic fantasy by its conclusion i recently rewatched ridley scotts alien and was entranced by the simple act of exploring a foreign planet such sequences too were the clear highlight of camerons film,positive

103,doc_104,some thoughts on this moviefirst in many ways it was very manipulative the bad guys were painted in the darkest tones while the aliens and nice humans were painted in the brightest colors no one was given any depth the amusingly named unobtainium really really is valuable but they never tell you for what or why they are willing to send people across the galaxy to die or kill for iteven the character design was pulling the heart strings of course the aliens look like your kittykat ooooooh how cute meanwhile your mercenaries looked like thugs and rednecksthe movie telegraphs its punches so loudly you might as well see the words plot point flash across the screens like when the alien babe tells the hero that riding the turok was a big honking deal well you wouldnt be losing any money betting hed be riding it by the end of the moviesome point were laughable like the mecha that happened to have a big knife as part of the equipment okay it looks cool and all but whats the practical application of that not to mention the tedious pace in parts of the film kind of like titanic when you said just hit the damned iceberg already not a bad film but really overrated,negative
104,doc_105,you cant really say more about avatar that has already been said however we will say that it definitely deserves a top spot in your bluray disc library from the opening space arrival scene to the final battle this film has it all in terms of a video feast for the eyes and excitement for the ears whether watching the 3d or 2d bluray version of this film the main things to take note of are outstanding black levels the scene where jake sully is trapped in the jungle at night and the fantastic color layering in the animals plants and landscapes presented in the filmalso although the soundtrack isnt the hitemoverthehead variety it is a great example of wellblended and properly balanced audio mixing which makes it the perfect complement for the video presentation of course the best way to watch this film is in 3d the 3d doesnt push you away but draws you into the fantastical world of pandora that james cameron created,positive
105,doc_106,i dont give a rip if people find this helpfulnot that i didnt totally enjoy this movie or terminator before it but james cameron needs to do one little thing add a writing credit to this film that says based upon the short story call me joe by poul anderson and maybe even a coauthor credit because cameron snagged large amounts of plot maybe even some dialogue how could cameron do this and not know that science fiction readers would not recognise a worldclass hugoaward winning story even the original day the earth stood still gave credit to the harry bates story farewell to the master and that was not even as highly recognised as call me joe is years after it was writtenavatar does not simply use little elements of that short story ut blatantly uses major plot elements including the very end these things were not created by james cameron they were created by a science fiction writer named poul anderson and these things were created not in but in if cameron thinks that he can just do this thing and people will not say anything about it hes mistaken i know he used it many other people know it and cameron himself knows it because practically everything that is in the short story has been either used outright or referred to in the filmanybody who has read the anderson work and then seeing this film can not afterward say that this is a coincidence or cameron has just borrowed a few of the things from that story no nope lets list the basic things which are similar1 a ruined person is given a job driving another body2 this body gives him full use of his legs the driver is exhilarated enjoying his new body as much as possible even razzing his superiors but the man who in the story is named ernest anglsey is chiefly most interested in one thing survival this parallels the film in every way possible3 the ruined persons actual body rapidly deteriorates while the avatar or in the case of the story psuedojovian body gets stronger this is a major plot element used in the film4 eventually the ruined mans brain has been moved compleately into the psuedojovian body5 in call me joe this story takes place on a moon of jupiter and on the surface of jupiter in avatar the planet pandora revolves around a superjovianthere had to be a process where this could happen in call me joe the machine in which the ruined guy sits is getting feedback from the brain of the psuedojovian and wrecking part of the machine a ktube in this regard avatar is changed from call me joe in which a technician is sent to investigate why the ktubes are failing this includes a twoyear jaunt in frozen sleep from earth to jupiter just like how avatar begins with sully taking a 5year trip in frozen sleep still not convinced the short story is told as a narrative by the technician avatar is told in a narrative by sully the technician cornelius is baffled but eventually discovers this it turns out that anglsey had been writing himself into the empty pseudo jovian brain the entire time a brain that was made better than a human brain so in the end of call me joe the man discards happily his old ruined body the doctors said he went out with a smile on his face and this is the exact ending of avatar cameron took this storyline and created a planet that could store a human mind a planet where every living thing can biologically interface with every other living thing because the trees are a hive mind of some sort not that i do not admit that i like the things cameron did with this story but he should have given poul anderson direct credit for this because as much as i wanted to believe that this was a total coincidence i cannot believe it now after watching this film cameron had to have deliberately used itnow regarding the film all i can say is wow and i apologies for having to include that previous spoiler it is a very good film and i would have loved to seen it in 3d seriously the only thing that annoyed me was camerons use of the story without giving credit the imagery is fantasticit is hard to imagine a planet that lights up at night it is hard to imagine live action blended with an eerie pixar style of animation the earthbased things people ships guns all look like they are from earth but the things that are from pandora look like they come from pandora especially when the two things are shown together james horner creates a great score using elements from aliens titanic and enemy at the gatesmy favourite shot is when the shuttle is first descending into the pit on pandora we do not understand the size of the pit until the next shot which reveals a massive machine digging up the groundcameron says a lot about ecology in this film he shows us the conflict between corporate and scientific and the resulting atrocities that occur this has even occurred in the us in our treatment of our indigenous population most of the things we use for energy today were life forms in the past and this concept it explored in the avatar material unobtanium named so because it probably cannot be obtainedregardless of camerons use of a classic short story without crediting it i highly enjoyed this but if cameron is thinking of any return trips to pandora he needs a return trip to the united states copyright office,positive
106,doc_107,in preparation for watching alita battle angel i decided to watch a film that revolutionised how cgi is used in avatar the highest grossing film of all time the premise of the film sees a disabled human travel to an alien planet where he makes a connection with the natives sam worthington was relativley new in this film and i thought he did an okay job in this film his dead pan humour actually worked in this film and made him a bit enjoyable to watch but most of the time he is just bland and boring as a performer in most of his films including this one the supporting cast is very good zoe saldana plays neytiri the local to the planet and she does a very good job in her role i actually found her character interesting and i cared about her more then the main character sigourney weaver does a great job in this film she delivers a charismatic charming performance showing just how good an actress she can be when she commits to a role stephen lang plays a villain in this film and he is so fun to watch in this film he revels in the role and is just an entertaining character to watch in this film giovanni ribisi isnt in this film a huge amount but he is a really good actor and i enjoyed watching him in his role in the film the story is simple to watch it is executed okay with you buying into the story as the film develops however this film is incredibly predictable and you realise that you know the ending way before it takes place the script is good with a decent mix of drama and umour at times the humour suprised me as it actually made me laugh at times the style of the film was the biggest selling point for this film and years later it mostly still holds up and looks fantastic the colour used in the film makes this such a vibrant film to watch and adds to the conflict in the film also even though this film is almost hours long it flows very well and i was enjoyed throughout overall this film is a great spectacle to watch that is definitly worth a watch,positive
107,doc_108,avatar is that rare film where everything you ever hear about it is absolutely true all the criticism is valid and all the praise is justified it really is the sibling of james camerons titanic in that it is a very ordinary story presented in an extraordinary fashion your opinion of it will be determined by whether you care about what a movie has to say or how it says itjake sully sam worthington is a crippled marine in a future where a corporation has established a mining colony on the alien world of pandora jakes twin brother was part of the avatar program where human beings have their minds projected into genetically engineered bodies that resemble the natives of pandora foot tall blue humanoids called the navi the idea is that by presenting themselves in similar forms they can more successfully interact with the navi when jakes brother dies the wheelchairbound marine is offered the chance to take his place because only someone with his brothers dna can drive his alien formwhen jake arrives on pandora and jumps into his navi body he finds himself caught between the scientist dr grace augustine sigourney weaver who wants jake to help her learn about the aliens and their world and colonel miles quaritch stephen lang who wants jake to get him militarily useful intelligence on the navi the head of the mining colony parker selfridge giovanni ribisi doesnt care a whit about jake he just wants the navi to leave their homes so he can dig up a mineral called unobtainium which is worth million dollars a kiloyou may have heard avatar described as dances with wolves in space well thats a pretty fair characterization as the rest of the movie is all about jake becoming part of the navi learning their ways falling in love with a female named neytiri zoe saldana and eventually siding with the aliens in spectacular battle against the humans that are trying to exploit pandora for their own needsthe computer generated images of avatar are the most extensive and best looking stuff thats ever been on the silver screen the scenery is incredibly detailed and realistic the pandoran wildlife and the navi themselves are phenomenally lifelike the advanced technology of the humans like their battletechstyle armored suits are more clearly defined and believably designed than anything youve seen before and unlike some films where the cgi action sequences turn into little more than blurs of color and motion cameron is able to slow things down and keep things clear so you can follow whats happening in even the most dynamic moments watching this entire film is like the first time you saw the dinosaurs in jurassic park or the morphing t1000 from terminator 2now the verisimilitude of computerized special effects doesnt really blow me away i certainly enjoyed looking at avatar but i generally need more than that and i just barely got it from this movie this is an extremely formulaic and pedestrian story theres nothing boring or stupid about it and if you took away all the cgi effects this script wouldnt have made a bad film it just wouldnt have ever been made into a film because theres nothing interesting or compelling about the tale cameron has written in fact there are a couple of points where it seems like cameron deliberately avoided more complex and potentially engaging story possibilities im not sure if he wanted to keep the story as dumbed down as possible or if he simply focused too much on the special effects but this is probably the least dramatically ambitious tale cameron has ever toldavatar is a fun exciting film to watch i can recommend it with no reservations but unless youre obsessed with the latest advances in cgi technology i cant really call it a must see,neutral
108,doc_109,hype can be a very dangerous thing though it is a valuable marketing tool it can also raise expectations to a point beyond which it becomes quite inevitable that the film in question will disappoint at least on one level in the case of avatar promises of a new revolutionary filmmaking style came along with the fact that for an entire generation of filmlovers ie those who were born in the 90s james cameron is a genius but also the pompous buffoon who proclaimed himself king of the world when titanic broke boxoffice records and won oscars some of which should have gone to la confidential this time however the hype was entirely justified avatar camerons first feature project in years is indeed an amazing achievementreturning to his genre of choice namely sciencefiction the director takes us to a new world named pandora an ideal place for colonization in a future where most of earths resources have run out a subtle social commentary since the air on pandora is toxic to humans interactions with the indigenous population called navi are made easier thanks to avatars artificial humannavi hybrids remotely controlled by selected members of a science program one of these people is jake sully a charismatic sam worthington a crippled marine who signs up for the gig when promised a chance to be able to walk again his pragmatism takes a step back however when he learns to appreciate the lifestyle of the blue huge felineshaped navi and falls for one of them the beautiful neytiri zoe saldana problems begin when it becomes clear corporations and military represented by giovanni ribisi and stephen lang dont care about the inhabitants only the planets resources which side will jake chooseyes the story isnt very original part dances with wolves part pocahontas its a classic western film subject in a scifi environment but its also pure cameron man versus technology ironic given the directors penchant for pushing the technical envelope on every movie he makes strong female characters saldana michelle rodriguez and ripley herself aka sigourney weaver tragic love although the two blue creatures kissing gets close to ridiculous james horners epic score complete with a song over the end credits grandiose battles as is often the case what matters is not what kind of story the director tells but how he does itand how does cameron do it he takes us to strange new worlds with an energy and a passion reminiscent of peter jackson pandora does look a bit like middle earth in places providing a feast for the eyes without ever losing track of the story to achieve this he personally developed a new 3d camera and waited over a decade for visual effects to be sufficiently evolved his patience is well rewarded instead of the usual object being thrown at you effect that is associated with 3d movies his use of the technology allows one to totally embrace his creation thanks to a unique sense of depth that gives the impression one actually is there with the characters naturally the third dimension adds extra spectacle come the massive final showdown which packs a neat aliens reference thus uniting the two camerons guerrilla auteur and ambitious blockbustermaker but the focus is always on setting and characters first action secondavatar is an important film a fundamental achievement in the entertainment industry its existence doesnt mark the death of traditional filmmaking honestly who would want to watch bergman or godard in 3d but it is a new exciting side of the art of bringing stories to the big screen make no mistake this is a film that has to be seen in cinemas and for once the extra dimension makes all the difference,positive
109,doc_110,theyve sent us a messagethat they can take whatever they want well we will send them a message that thisthis is our land james camerons avatar is a film that took years in the making it was a project that was really close to cameron and he waited for the right time to be able to release this movie he payed close attention to every detail and perfected the way we see movies in 3d the effort was not cheap as this film is reported to be the most expensive movie ever made avatar will mark a before and after in film history for special effects and 3d all the critics agree that this film is visually stunning and there is no doubt it will win several awards for special effects and art direction i dont think it will win as much awards as titanic camerons last film did or even match its record breaking box office but it will be remembered for all the technical and visual breakthroughs one thing is for sure it will not win any acting awards james cameron has proved in hollywood that he is a great director and that he is on par with spielberg when it comes to special effects he has directed several blockbuster movies such as aliens terminator titanic and now avatar is becoming a hit worldwide visually speaking this movie deserves ten stars but the story is not up to par with the visuals moviegoers who enjoy great special effects and visuals will be blown away by this movie but fans who enjoy good storytelling and writing will leave unimpressed by camerons effort i am more into the storytelling so for me this movie dragged for long periods of times and the plot was very predictable i felt like i was at an art museum looking at all these famous masterpieces but i wasnt entertained throughout the two and a half hours i felt good about the visuals and they were truly remarkable but i didnt walk out of the theater impressed i remember when spielbergs jurrasic park came out and that experience was much more breathtaking than this one i guess i wasnt blown away by avatar and i would find it difficult to sit through two and a half hours to watch this movie againas far as the story goes avatar takes place in the future to be exact in a planet named pandora pandora has a rich and extensive fauna and the natives that inhabit it known as the navis are very connected to this nature and even worship the mother tree as their god humans have set a military base in the planet because it is rich in a new type of mineral or chemical element a gray rock which happens to sell for million a kilo this mineral happens to be under the surface where the navis live so a group of scientists have tried to fit in with the natives by creating avatars which are alien bodies controlled through human minds an approach we have seen before similar to the matrix or surrogates these avatars are controlled by dr grace augustine sigourney weaver who has already worked with cameron in aliens jake sully sam worthington the australian actor who starred in this years terminator film and norm spellman joel moore who is known for his comedic role in dodgeball jake sully a paraplegic ex marine is accepted by the tribe and begins to learn from their culture thanks in most part to the beautiful neytiri zoe saldana who had a role in this years star trek the tribe chiefs daughter who teaches him how to connect with the environment and all he needs to know in order to survive in the jungles of pandora jake begins to have mixed feelings towards the natives and towards his commanders col miles quaritch stephen lang public enemies who has promised to give him the money for the spinal surgery for the exchange of information and parker selfridge giovanni ribisi the greedy corporate boss in charge of the mission from this point on one cannot help but compare the plot to pocahontas it is just an alien version of the new world avatar becomes very predictable and we know what is going to happen but fans are not into this for the plot the audience is here for the visual spectaclethe film might be disappointing plot wise but the special effects make up for it as i said before those film buffs that are into movies for the storytelling will probably be a little unhappy with avatar like i was but those who are into the visuals and special effects will leave this film with a huge smile on their faces there is no doubt james cameron has spent the money wisely and created an entire new world with a beautiful scenery and some cool creatures the first hour and a half dragged a little but once we get to the last hour with the battle scenes the movie really picks up the final battle is one of the greatest action sequences in film on par with the star wars saga or the lord of the ring franchise or even the matrix trilogy however avatar took a little too long to get to this point as it had to introduce us to this new planet dont get me wrong avatar is a good movie but i think there are other films that are much better than this one to be considered in my top list of i was a little disappointed because all of the hype this movie was receiving,neutral
110,doc_111,far far far too many approach this film as if narrative originality is the sole criteria to judge a film on it is true that the film has a lot in common with several other natures gentlemen stories released in the past years the overall film conforms to the dances with wolves template the special editions the far stronger cut even adds a buffalo hunt but jake sully is no mere lt dunbar clone far too many commentators do not take into account that sully is disabled moreover his disability renders him not a man in the eyes of the americansorry earthicanpower structure this marginalization and jakes desire to be seen as fully masculine greatly shift much of the tonalities of the narrative it does raise a different set of difficulties around disability so much so that if you think the story is just the natures gentlemen trope you are not paying attention the film is highly critical of western civilization and technology from the perspective of many type of people not just the first people the obvious analog for the navi the irony of what the film is about and how it was made of course isnt lost on cameron and the inattentive viewer will find metacommentary the story is good all stories deploy tropes avatar is just a bit more obvious in where its narrative ideas come fromanyway qualms about the narrative are largely besides the point the film is so unbelievably good because it is an experience i mean this in the sense that a very vivid thunderstorm is an experience the film stands apart from not only the other films that use the same tropes but other works period through the use of absolutely cutting edge and breath taking cgi exquisite art direction and the directors hand the film is completely immersive the way very few films are to use a quick example cameron sparingly uses pov shots at critical moments ie when getting off the ship for the first time jake waking up in the avatar which not only highlight jakes journey but place you in the world of the film pandora is so wonderfully realized i simply cannot wait for the sequels to see more of this stuffthere is a bluntness to writingunobtainium graceselfridge shock and awethat is often mocked but i find that the bluntness fits the storys anticolonialism is sadly always relevant and there is something utterly satisfying watching the americanssorry earthicanslose to nature for once the films politics are hamfisted for sure but how could they not be the film is all italics and boldnessthis is a truly great film,positive

114,doc_115,yes the day the earth stood still original is still probably champ but this film gives it a run for its money i had thought james cameron to be an egotistical meglomaniac when i saw him at the academy award ceremonies for titantic but i have changed my mind after avatar cameron is a very good writer and director his sets special effects makeup and production values for avatar are unsurpassed the acting crew led by buffedup gary sinese as an alltime heavy is more than competent sigorney weaver who does her impression of margaret mead the famous anthropologist does a very credible job as well the sets are magnificent as issac asimov once said you can only write good sciencefiction if you are able to create a believable environment that surrounds your story well cameron accomplished that to his credit philosophically however the film is much deeper than the eye candy that we behold for almost two hours ultimately this film is a tragedy or triumph depending on your life view man vs science and nature is an eternal struggle it appears as if nature wins this one but there is plenty of precedent for nature getting clobbered by science and man in the history of mankind the american indian who should have slaughtered the first settlers of the american continent made a fatal mistake and allowed them to live alongside them ultimately these invaders destroyed the american indian and its culture the same could be said for ancient man evolution generally wipes out any previous edition that has basic flaws but is that nature or science there were sequences in the film that were reminiscent of bury my heart at wounded knee the last samurai star wars mutiny on the bounty and full metal jacket an animated film forbidden planet also came to mind the vietnam war apocalypse now platoon go tell the spartans also had parallels the iraq occupation has parallels haleburton anyone there are political considerations conservative hardliners might favor the colonists liberals would naturally tend to favor the natives but nature has no political alliance nature overcomes all political and religious beliefs there is no need to go any further than deep impact to realize that scenario the bad one not the lucky one or sunshine once again bad scenario not the lucky one science and man are always destined to lose to nature the vast majority of times occasionally science and man wins but those wins are only temporary nature always wins in the end,positive

121,d0c_122,james cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production the marvelous and wonderful avatar a film with non stop energy that entertains teaches and delights us though not completely original the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screenavatar is the story of the conflicts between two worlds one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight as we are introduced to the wonders of pandora an ironic name if any the wonders begin cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous cgi creatures come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of jurassic park and king kong but the new animals show more force and agility and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to bethe crowning jewel are the humanoids native to pandora tall and proud blue skinned beings lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast a million years ahead of the work done with similar process by zemeckis in the disturbing polar express and christmas carol the people from pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak most incredible work is done by worthington and saldana as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each otherhumand eventually try to encroach over the people of pandoras natural resources by any means necessary and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives spirits these are powerful scenes full of an intensity rarely seen in epicfantasy films and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by scott in kingdom of heaven and stones alexander a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination and the results are magnificentfinally i cant heap enough praise upon this sensation movie the best of one that is as powerful as departures as imaginative and entertaining as star trek full of some of the wonder of up and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of robin williams in the worlds greatest dad and jessica biels and kristin scottthomas in easy virtue films that like avatar are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power how does one know that a film will become a classic when one leave the theatre and cant wait to see it again for the sum of its parts not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold cameron has made sure avatars separate parts all work in tune from its performances to its screenplay to its editing and special effects never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us a great film,positive
122,doc_123,recap mankind has gone for the stars and found a treasure of the rare material unobtanium in the planet pandora covered by a beautiful but deceptively dangerous jungle a big part of the human colony is security forces and that is how disabled veteran marine jake sully ends up there going in place of his dead brother he operates an avatar to reach out to the humanoid native species the navi the navi is in extreme touch with nature depends and protects it at any cost and it is soon clear that their interest comes in clear conflict with the humans greedy mining intentions and of course jake ends up in the middle of this feeling more and more sympathy for the awe inspiring nature and finding love with the navicomments despite not seeing this in 3d but only on a bluray this still is stunningly beautiful picture with marvelous sceneries landscapes and vistas not to mention wonderful details it is instantly obvious that this is a movie heavy in the visual experience and despite coming with heavy praise it doesnt disappoint even though some scenes are clearly solely there to impress 3dwatchers still many scenes are just breathtaking it is a marvel of light and colour in the hands of a playful imaginative mind or more probably minds most impressive and most entertainingbut the danger with movies becoming so heavily focused on the visual and effects part is that the story might be somewhat forgotten or at least having to take the back seat avatar along with for example suffers from this in avatars case a very big part of the framework of the story is almost copypasted from an old western movie complete with stereotypes of the evil white ranchers and the primitive but in touch with nature natives it annoyed me that a movie with such a big budget and made with such an enormous effort couldnt be more original than that however a cliché is often a cliché for a reason and in this case it is because it provides a simple story with a clear conflict to exploit with stunning effectssam worthington has quickly established himself as a lead man in action movies and with good support from sigourney weaver zoe saldana michelle roudrigez stephen lang and joel moore among many others there is absolutely nothing to complain about the cast or their performancesin all avatar was a refreshingly good movie long as it is something is always happening or there is something breathtaking to watch it is entertaining every minute even if predictable it is a real treat and im thankful that once in a while someone sets their minds to make an epic film like avatar and note that is almost always a scifi highly recommended and would have been a fullpointer if there would have been just a little more effort on a more original script810,positive
123,doc_124,at this point the smothering hype machine has told you all you really need to know about avatar james camerons muchanticipated return to the cinematic fray insofar as visual impact is concerned this could very well be the crowning achievement of and certainly an apt way to end the first decade of the new millennium with a literal world of intricate detail on display populated by characters and creatures that run the gamut from beautiful anthropomorphs to grotesque hybrids of prehistoric creatures when viewed in 3d avatar is nothing short of breathtaking and forgives much of the films storytelling shortcomings the bottom line is this is a simple plot the militaryindustrial complex wants some preciousvaluable resource from an indigenous population said population is not going to give it up without a fight that is not new and often monotonously stretched through a series of anticlimaxes until it settles on a proper ending while there is a stinging indictment of human greed and military intervention on display its nothing we havent seen before in the post911 cinematic climate and granted cameronwho also wrote the scripthas always worked better with conceptual ideas than narrative intricacies yet avatar while heavyhanded in its telling is less about a message and more about the experience overall i was frequently taken aback and awed by the imagery on display and in a medium that at its best demands we be shown and not told whats going on avatar is about as good as it gets75 out of,positive
124,doc_125,in the year jake sully a crippled marine is sent to the hostile planet pandora to be part of the avatar program the object is to gain the trust of the indigenous navi people by using mindoperated geneticallyengineered navi bodies jake befriends the local clan but finds he is caught between the freespirited ecologically minded navi and his human masters who want to exploit pandora for its mineral worth which side will he choose like most of camerons films avatar is not so much a movie as a phenomenal event and thats not necessarily a good thing it is a good movie though full of incredible vistas and amazing mocap cg work driven along by a great story and heartfelt characterisations pandora looks just stunning packed full of amazing greenery incredible creatures rich colours and a jawdropping sense of depth so many scenes involve cliffs mountains and huge spaces contrasted with dense undergrowth fragile flowers and pinpoints of light the navi too look amazing giant but elfin creatures irrevocably linked to the earth and the sky dignified and powerful yet also vulnerable the photography and james horners rich music really create a majestic sense of place and space the cast are also firstrate unknown worthington is great in the lead managing the always difficult character arc of someone switching allegiance with subtlety and skill saldana whilst only ever appearing in animation demonstrates well how far this technology has come as all the nuances of her performance are reflected in the visual effects jobbing tough guy lang has the role of a lifetime as the jarhead villain rodriguez is good as always and weaver is terrific as the heroic dr augustine reuniting with cameron twentythree years after aliens if the movie has a weakness for me its the plot which is more than a little reminiscent of some classic sf novels particularly dune and there are some points it glosses over just a little too conveniently how exactly do the humans make the avatar bodies complete with a neuralnetwork plugin hair extension the movie was extremely successful winning three academy awards many other accolades and grossing around three billion dollars to become perhaps the most financially successful film ever in some senses this is great because it is a visually stunning and beautifully constructed picture but in a way its also disappointing because an obscene amount was spent on its production and promotion and its focus on extremely expensive technology is i believe counterproductive to healthy and dynamic filmmaking but its still a mustsee movie brilliantly written and directed by cameron and packed with amazing scenes and images which linger in the mind long after the screen has gone dark,neutral
